upgrading dependencies (basically deleting Cargo.lock) in a big rust project I hit an issue.  A new commit in serde_json caused has upstream failure in another library, jmespath, and possibly more crates. Because these structs and enums visibility has changed, this could be interpreted as a breaking change, depending on what you consider public.\nWhile jmespath was doing the wrong thing here, using undocumented API, it got me thinking about what can library maintainers and library consumers do to ensure semver compatibility, and what tools are out there to assist both groups.\nWhat is Semantic Versioning\nSemantic versioning (semver) is one standard used for version numbers which appears to have gained the most traction.   Since cargo and friends use semver to identify what versions to use, it is important to understand (excuse my pun) the semantics of what this means.\nThe full documentation of semver is on https://semver.org/, but for brevity there are 3 numbers:\n\nMajor: Any breaking API changes\nMinor: Additions of new features or functionality that are backwards compatible\nPatch: Bugfixes\n\nThere is some interesting differences for libraries &lt; 1.0.0 which I was not aware of for longer than I care to admit.  Namely either minor or patch numbers can be changes as you see fit.  I.e, 0.3.0 could be wildly different from 0.3.1, including breaking changes.\nHowever: Cargo is more strict than the semver documentation for &lt; 1.0.0 libraries:\n\nThis compatibility convention is different from SemVer in the way it treats versions before 1.0.0. While SemVer says there is no compatibility before 1.0.0, Cargo considers 0.x.y to be compatible with 0.x.z, where y ≥ z and x &gt; 0.\n\nWhy we need it\nWe need some way of portraying changes to an API and, while it's not perfect, it appears to be a defacto standard which makes interoperability with other libraries and crates a lot easier.\nIt also gives cargo a programmatic way of finding updated versions, when it's used appropriately.\nSo it is one part advertising the intent of the version and another part ensuring that things will compile if you bump up certain numbers.\nAPI Evolution RFC\nThe Semver website is very general in its language and isn't specific to rust.  There is, however, a great RFC that has some excellent guidelines both for the language itself &amp; for library maintainers: RFC 1105: API Evolution\nHere are a couple of excerpts:\n\nMajor change: going from stable to nightly\nChanging a crate from working on stable Rust to requiring a nightly is\nconsidered a breaking change. That includes using #[feature] directly, or\nusing a dependency that does so. Crate authors should consider using Cargo\n\"features\" for\ntheir crate to make such use opt-in.\n\n\nMajor change: renaming/moving/removing any public items.\nAlthough renaming an item might seem like a minor change, according to the\ngeneral policy design this is not a permitted form of breakage: it's not\npossible to annotate code in advance to avoid the breakage, nor is it possible\nto prevent the breakage from affecting dependencies.\n\nThis RFC has some great advice, and I wish it was more publicly known, but seems relatively obscure.\nThe Non-Exhaustive Attribute\nAnother RFC related to versioning is Non-Exhaustive, which is a handy way of planning breaking changes ahead of time.  It works with enums by forcing open ended match statements, which means consumers of your enum won't break if a new variant is introducted. It also works with structs and ensures users consuming libraries can't create them.\nThis was recently stabilised in Rust 1.40 so it's a rather new feature of the language (on a side note: it's not easy to find when a particular RFC is stabilised, it would be great to have this reflected in the RFC somewhere).\nAs an example if you have an enum like this:\n#[non_exhaustive]\npub enum Error {\n    Message(String),\n    Other,\n}\n\nYou would need to match against the enum like this:\nmatch error {\n    Message(ref s) =&gt; ...,\n    Other =&gt; ...,\n    _ =&gt; ...,\n}\n\nYour library could then introduce a new variant, which wouldn't break the existing consumer:\n#[non_exhaustive]\npub enum Error {\n    Message(String),\n    IOError,\n    Other,\n}\n\nOther Tools\nThere have been some tools to both manage breaking changes in the past, a lot of the things I found were unmaintained or not in active use.  There might also be some great language features that I haven't discovered yet that crate authors are already using.\nThe Semver Trick\nDocumented here is the semver trick, which touts to be able to assist in this with downstream dependencies.\nThere is mention of a libcpocalypse, which does not sound nice and may happen again if there is a major version increase to libc.  I tried to find some information about where this had happened before but searching for the term circles back to this project and doesn't give a great overview of the pains users had to go through before.\nRust Semverver\nrust-semverver is a Google Summer of Code Project which checks semver compliance with rust crates by using a novel approach:\n\nThe approach taken is to compile both versions of the crate to rlibs and to link them as dependencies of a third, empty, dummy crate. Then, a custom compiler driver is run on the said dummy and all necessary analysis is performed in that context, where type information and other resources are available.\n\nSemantic-RS\nAn existing tool called semantic-rs touts to be able to do this for your crates automatically.  This doesn't appear to have any changes for over a year, but does have an active issue register, but no PRs have been accepted for a while.  It is highly opinionated as well, and may not be appropriate to bolt on to an existing library.  This looks like something you need to use from the beginning as well.\nRust Breaking Changes\nThis also doesn't appear to be maintained, but was an automatic listing of breaking changes to rust: https://killercup.github.io/bitrust/.   I do wonder though how many of those changes are internal, as I don't believe there have been many external breaking changes.\nFuture Proofing\nThere is a chapter of the Rust API Guidelines which deals with how to future proof an API, but as with other tools I have found does not appear to be updated in quite a while:\nFuture Proofing: https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/future-proofing.html\nConclusion\nWhile there has been a historic push to get crates to 1.0.0, There does not appear to be much in the way of modern tooling in order to help with this and the focus of previous efforts see them moving elsewhere.\nWith more libraries reaching 1.0.0 I think it's important to introduce more safety nets for library authors and consumers.  As an idea, we can potentially see whether a crate has breaking change through lints etc.. so why don't we do that when we publish to crates.io?\nThere is a lot of room for improvement here, and as new users come on board and new companies look at adopting, it's important that the stability of semver is maintained.  I still think the way that cargo handles this is much better than other ecosystems.\n","id":"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/breaking-api-changes/","title":"Handling Breaking API Changes"},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/creating-your-own-derive-macro/":{"body":"One of the things I tackled early on with when creating DiveDB was trying to import a lot of metrics from dive logs. At regular intervals, normally every 10 seconds, a dive computer will record metrics about the dive, such as depth, tank pressure, water temperature etc... While this isn't a huge amount of entries, nearly every SQL framework I used for it was painfully slow at importing this type of data.\nThe only crate that I managed to get to work with reasonable performance was tokio-postgres.  Itself being lightweight: it doesn't include a lot of features you would expect from a full blown SQL framework like diesel or SQLx. I was OK with that, I don't mind writing a bit of raw SQL, but one thing I thought was missing was some sort of way to create a struct from a database row.\nSo I set out to make a really simple trait to hydrate a struct from a row. The obvious candidate for this is a procedural macro. Writing procedural macros has been written about before, but I haven't found a terse enough guide that I was happy with. I wanted to document my approach in the odd chance it helps other people.  At the very least I have something to refer to if I need to do this again!\nAim of the Macro\nThe Aim of the macro is to be able to write #[derive(MyTrait)] and have it fill in the trait implementation at compile time.\nIn this case I will be deriving a simple trait that looks like this:\nuse tokio_postgres::Row;\nuse anyhow::Error;\n\npub trait FromRow {\n    /// hydrate a struct from a database `Row`\n    fn from_row(row: Row) -&gt; Result&lt;Self, Error&gt;\n    where\n        Self: std::marker::Sized;\n\n}\n\nThere are a few things I have made the decision not to handle to keep things simple:\n\nSQLx is already has some great macros for validating against a live schema. I don't want to reimplement this here.\nI don't want to pay the cost of column index lookups for named fields. Instead, we will use indices and expect the queries we write return fields in correct order.\n\nSo if I have a struct like this:\npub struct DiveMetric {\n    pub time: i32,\n    pub depth: f32,\n    pub pressure: Option&lt;f32&gt;,\n    pub temperature: Option&lt;f32&gt;,\n}\n\nIt should automatically derive the trait like so:\nimpl FromRow for DiveMetric {\n    fn from_row(row: Row) -&gt; Result&lt;Self, Error&gt; {\n        Ok(Self {\n            time: row.try_get(0)?,\n            depth: row.try_get(1)?,\n            pressure: row.try_get(2)?,\n            temperature: row.try_get(3)?,\n        })\n    }\n}\n\nCrate Layout\nYou will need at minimum 2 crates to do this:\n\nOne crate for the macro itself.  I.e, it has proc-macro = true in the Manifest, I called this macro\nOne crate has the definitions of the trait. I have called this core.  This crate will include the macro as a dependency\nAny extra crates that require this can depend on core\n\nProcedural Macro Crate\nA Procedural Macro Crate is built at compile time and can influence your source code, pretty much by injecting source code in the form of \"tokens\" in-line with the rest of your code. \nThe TokenStream interface is very very bare minimum.  You get a list of these tokens and it's up to you to work out what they mean.  Luckily there is a crate out there, syn, for parsing a TokenStream into a higher level structure.  Think reflection but at compile time.\nSo firstly, let's set up the crate manifest:\n[package]\nname = \"divedb_macro\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nedition = \"2021\"\n\n[lib]\nproc-macro = true\n\n[dependencies]\nsyn = { version = \"2\", features = [\"full\", \"parsing\"] }\n\nThis is a standard crate, with the only difference is in that lib section: we tell it this is a proc-macro crate.\nThen, we are going to create a derive macro with the same name as the trait, i.e, FromRow.  We will just create this in lib.rs the entrypoint to our crate.\nThe scaffolding we have to lay out is a method that looks something like this:\nuse proc_macro::TokenStream;\n\n#[proc_macro_derive(FromRow)]\npub fn derive_from_row(input: TokenStream) -&gt; TokenStream {\n    // do something with the token stream here\n}\n\nParsing the TokenStream\nFirst step is to convert a TokenStream into a structure we can work with.  We'll use syn to do the heavy lifting here.  There are some helper methods to parse out as a DeriveInput struct:\nlet input = parse_macro_input!(input as DeriveInput);\n\nLooking at DeriveInput, there is the Data enum, which is an enum of 3 different types, Struct, Enum or Union. \nWe only care about structs, and don't want to derive it for anything else.\nSo what we can do is an if let match on the variant we want, and otherwise error out with some sort of message that will hopefully remind you when you derive it later on.  There are a few ways to error out &amp; most require a span: the portion of the TokenStream that relates to the error.  I.e, where the red squiggly line will show up. You can also panic! if you are shortcutting massively, but I wouldn't recommend it.\nI've elected to do a catchall in the case it's not in a structure that I want to support. \nUsing syn::Error, we can provide it a span, and a message.\nSince our method needs to return a TokenStream, not a syn::Error, we can convert the error by injecting a compile_error!() in the form of a TokenStream by using the to_compile_error() function:\n#[proc_macro_derive(FromRow)]\npub fn derive_from_row(input: TokenStream) -&gt; TokenStream {\n    let input = parse_macro_input!(input as DeriveInput);\n\n    // Do something with the fields here\n\n    // Catchall if we don't match on the structure we don't want\n    TokenStream::from(\n        syn::Error::new(\n            input.ident.span(),\n            \"Only structs with named fields can derive `FromRow`\"\n        ).to_compile_error()\n    )\n}\n\nA lot of the examples for proc macros I've seen introduce more methods and structure here, but for brevity I've kept it all in the one method.\nWith our high level structure out of the way, we can do an if let match on finding a struct:\nif let syn::Data::Struct(ref data) = input.data {\n    // we know it's a struct\n\n}\n\nYou'll find that there are actually 3 variants of a struct: Named field structs, Unnamed (tuple) structs and unit structs:\nstruct Named {\n    field: String\n}\n\nstruct Unnamed(String);\n\nstruct Unit;\n\nIt might be important if you are fleshing out a derive macro to deal with those other two cases. For this macro we only care about the first variant, the name field struct, not the other two. So we match on that:\nif let Fields::Named(ref fields) = data.fields {\n    // Deal with a named-field struct\n\n}\n\nEmitting our TokenStream\nFrom here, we want to iterate over the fields, and for each field emit a bit of code like:\n&lt;field_name&gt;: row.try_get(&lt;field_idx&gt;)?,\n\nHowever: we can't just send a String back from our method, we need to provide a TokenStream.  This is where the second handy crate comes in: quote. We can use the quote! macro to generate code snippets in a mostly-readable fashion and output them as a TokenStream.  One thing to note: quote! will return a proc_macro2 TokenStream, so you can either call into() or use TokenStream::from.\nSo let's iterate over our fields, and for each field, return a snippet, a TokenStream, which we can combine later:\nlet field_vals = fields.named.iter().enumerate().map(|(i, field)| {\n    // grab the name of the field\n    let name = &amp;field.ident;\n    quote!(#name: row.try_get(#i)?)\n});\n\nWe're using the standard iter().enumerate() here to get out an index number of the field and the field.ident to reflect the name of the field.\nAs an alternative, if instead you wanted to use column names instead of column indices, you could adjust this easily:\nlet field_vals = fields.named.iter().map(|field| {\n    let name = field.ident.as_ref().unwrap();\n    let name_string = name.to_string();\n    quote!(#name: row.try_get(#name_string)?)\n});\n\nOk, now we have a list of fields, and for each field, we have a snippet of source code, the next is to combine them and implement the FromRow trait.  Once again we can use quote! to do this.\nAnother thing worth noting is that it's as if the proc macro literally injects a bit of source code in-line where you call derive. This means that if you are going to refer to any structs/crates/modules etc.. it makes things a lot easier to refer to them via their full path.  I.e, don't put Row, put ::tokio_postgres::Row instead.\nWith that in mind, here's our simple quote! statement:\nlet name = input.ident;\n\nquote!(\nimpl ::divedb_core::FromRow for #name {\n    fn from_row(row: ::tokio_postgres::Row) -&gt; Result&lt;Self, ::anyhow::Error&gt; {\n        Ok(Self {\n            #(#field_vals),*\n        })\n    }\n})\n\nMost of this is self-explanatory.  The only weird/interesting thing is this part:\n#(#field_vals),*\n\nThis will just iterate over our field vals, and include each one.\nPutting it all together, we get a pretty terse, but powerful proc macro:\nuse proc_macro::TokenStream;\nuse quote::quote;\nuse syn::{parse_macro_input, DeriveInput, Fields};\n\n/// This derives the `FromRow` trait for structs\n/// Requires that the query is in field order, as it just uses row indices\n#[proc_macro_derive(FromRow)]\npub fn derive_from_row(input: TokenStream) -&gt; TokenStream {\n    // Parse it as a proc macro\n    let input = parse_macro_input!(input as DeriveInput);\n\n    if let syn::Data::Struct(ref data) = input.data {\n        if let Fields::Named(ref fields) = data.fields {\n            let field_vals = fields.named.iter().enumerate().map(|(i, field)| {\n                let name = &amp;field.ident;\n                quote!(#name: row.try_get(#i)?)\n            });\n\n            let name = input.ident;\n\n            return TokenStream::from(quote!(\n            impl divedb_core::FromRow for #name {\n                fn from_row(row: tokio_postgres::Row) -&gt; Result&lt;Self, anyhow::Error&gt; {\n                    Ok(Self {\n                        #(#field_vals),*\n                    })\n                }\n            }));\n        }\n    }\n\n    TokenStream::from(\n        syn::Error::new(\n            input.ident.span(),\n            \"Only structs with named fields can derive `FromRow`\",\n        )\n        .to_compile_error(),\n    )\n}\n\nCore Crate\nThe core crate implements the trait itself &amp; also exports the macro as well.  If the macro &amp; trait are the same name, you can cheat and pub use the macro crate so you don't always have to import the macro &amp; trait separately.\nOtherwise the core lib.rs is rather simple:\nuse anyhow::Error;\n// Export our derive macro here.\npub use divedb_macro::*;\nuse tokio_postgres::Row;\n\n/// Really simple ORM for `tokio_postgres`\npub trait FromRow {\n    /// hydrate a struct from a database `Row`\n    fn from_row(row: Row) -&gt; Result&lt;Self, Error&gt;\n    where\n        Self: std::marker::Sized;\n\n    ...\n}\n\nStandard Crate\nNow we have the macro crate, the core crate, we can simply use this to derive on our own types:\nuse divedb_core::FromRow;\n\n#[derive(FromRow)]\npub struct DiveMetric {\n    pub time: i32,\n    pub depth: f32,\n    pub pressure: Option&lt;f32&gt;,\n    pub temperature: Option&lt;f32&gt;,\n}\n\nExpanding the Macro\nRemember when I said that these macros pretty much inject more source code in line?  Well you can see that intermediate output rather easily by using cargo expand.  This will print out the results of the macro expansion and show what code is actually being generated &amp; a lot more.  If you are writing something super tricky, it really helps to see this output &amp; makes a great tool for debugging procedural macros.\nI.e, for our above DiveMetric struct, using column indices:\nimpl divedb_core::FromRow for DiveMetric {\n    fn from_row(row: tokio_postgres::Row) -&gt; Result&lt;Self, anyhow::Error&gt; {\n        Ok(Self {\n            time: row.try_get(0usize)?,\n            depth: row.try_get(1usize)?,\n            pressure: row.try_get(2usize)?,\n            temperature: row.try_get(3usize)?,\n        })\n    }\n}\n\nAnd for using the column name variant:\nimpl divedb_core::FromRow for DiveMetric {\n    fn from_row(row: tokio_postgres::Row) -&gt; Result&lt;Self, anyhow::Error&gt; {\n        Ok(Self {\n            time: row.try_get(\"time\")?,\n            depth: row.try_get(\"depth\")?,\n            pressure: row.try_get(\"pressure\")?,\n            temperature: row.try_get(\"temperature\")?,\n        })\n    }\n}\n\nConclusion\nAs you see, it's not too onerous to make your own custom derives.  There is a bit of boilerplate that is needed, but you can write code to write code and keep things simple.\nWithout greater support for compile time reflection in rust, you can reach for macros to help you remove the repetitive tasks we face as programmers\n","id":"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/creating-your-own-derive-macro/","title":"Creating your own custom derive macro"},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/drawing-svg-graphs-rust/":{"body":"I have just released the first version of lorikeet-dash and part of that exercise was to find out a way to draw SVG graphs using rust.\nI thought my findings &amp; approach may be useful for others looking to do the same thing and so I have documented the design evolution in this blog.\nHere's what the end result looks like in the lorikeet-dash project:\n\nDefining the Graph\nFirst we want to define what a graph is.  A minimal example of what a graph would have is:\n\nA List of Points\nA Name/Description\nA Colour for the line\n\nSo, in a rust struct, this would look like the following:\n#[derive(Clone, Debug)]\npub struct Graph {\n    pub name: String,\n    pub points: Vec&lt;Point&gt;,\n    pub colour: String\n}\n\n#[derive(Clone, Debug, Copy)]\npub struct Point {\n    pub x: f64,\n    pub y: f64,\n}\n\nLet's add some initial helper methods, one to create a new graph, and another to add points to it:\nimpl Graph {\n    pub fn new(name: String, colour: String) -&gt; Self {\n        Graph {\n            name,\n            points: Vec::new(),\n            colour,\n        }\n    }\n    pub fn add_point(&amp;mut self, x: f64, y: f64) {\n        self.points.push(Point { x, y });\n    }\n}\n\nSVG Template\nAn SVG image is an XML file, which means that we can use standard templating engines to generate SVG with some parameters.  I am going to use tera in this example, as lorikeet already uses it.  You could, however, use any template engine.\nLet's start with a simple SVG template, of which just simply draws the graph name:\n&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" standalone=\"no\"?&gt;\n&lt;svg\n  width=\"100%\"\n  height=\"100%\"\n  viewBox=\"0 0 {{height + padding * 2}} {{width + padding * 2}}\"\n  preserveAspectRatio=\"xMidYMid meet\"\n  xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\n  &gt;\n  &lt;text \n    x=\"{{width/2 + padding}}\"\n    y=\"{{padding / 2}}\"\n    font-family=\"-apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, Roboto\"\n    dominant-baseline=\"middle\"\n    text-anchor=\"middle\"\n    font-size=\"18\"\n    fill=\"#74838f\"\n    font-weight=\"700\"\n    &gt;\n    {{name}}\n  &lt;/text&gt;\n&lt;/svg&gt;\n\nLet's visit some decisions I have made here:\n\nWe are including a width &amp; height for the viewbox.  Having the SVG display at its natural resolution increases the clarity of the line, so we'll allow them to be adjusted when generating an SVG.\nThere is a padding value to include around the graph so that axis labels and the name of the graph will fit on the SVG.  To make things simple this can be hardset to a value such as 50.  We'll subtract that x 2 from the provided width/height.\nWe're using a big font-family list which should display roughly similar fonts depending on your OS.\n\nWith our tera template svg ready, we can use the include_str macro to have this compiled in:\nTera::one_off(include_str!(\"graph.svg\"), &amp;context, true).expect(\"Could not draw graph\")\n\nDrawing the Name\nWe'll add a draw_svg(&amp;self, width: usize, height: usize) method to the Graph struct which should start by drawing the name as per the above template.  The arguments are simply the width &amp; height to draw.  To ensure that the viewbox of the svg comes out the right size, we'll subtract the padding from both x 2.\nTo put it another way, the width and height become the width and height of the graph itself rather than the SVG.\npub fn draw_svg(&amp;self, width: usize, height: usize) -&gt; String {\n\n    let mut context = Context::new();\n\n    //hardset the padding around the graph\n    let padding = 50;\n\n    //ensure the viewbox is as per input\n    let width = width - padding * 2;\n    let height = height - padding * 2;\n\n    context.insert(\"name\", &amp;self.name);\n    context.insert(\"width\", &amp;width);\n    context.insert(\"height\", &amp;height);\n    context.insert(\"padding\", &amp;padding);\n\n    Tera::one_off(include_str!(\"graph.svg\"), &amp;context, true).expect(\"Could not draw graph\")\n\n}\n\nThe Context here is what tera uses to provide variables to a template.  Anything that implements serde::Serialize can be put into the context.  At this moment we're providing a few strings and width/height parameters.\nThis can be run to spit out an SVG:\nfn main() {\n    let graph = Graph::new(\"Example\".into(), \"#8ff0a4\".into());\n\n    println!(\"{}\", graph.draw_svg(800, 400));\n}\n\nRunning this, should output the following SVG:\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nDrawing the Points\nLet's fill up the graph with some dummy points so we have something to draw (note: we are assuming you'll add the points in order here):\ngraph.add_point(1.0, 1.0);\ngraph.add_point(2.0, 3.0);\ngraph.add_point(3.0, 2.5);\ngraph.add_point(4.0, 6.0);\ngraph.add_point(5.0, 3.0);\n\nScaling the Axis\nTo keep things simple, we'll start from the origin &amp; scale both the x and y axis by the max value of either.  We'll pull out both of those values and use these to scale the points within the svg:\nlet max_x = self\n  .points\n  .iter()\n  .map(|point| point.x)\n  .fold(0. / 0., f64::max);\n\nlet max_y = self\n  .points\n  .iter()\n  .map(|point| point.y)\n  .fold(0. / 0., f64::max);\n\nDrawing a Line\nTo draw a line between points in an SVG, you can use the path element with draw commands.  A simple line would look like:\n&lt;path d=\"M10 10 L15 15\"/&gt;\n\nThat is: move to point 10,10 and then draw a line to point 15,15.  These points are in the SVG space, so we will need to translate our graph points onto this space, keeping in mind padding, width and height and scaling.\nTranslating the points\nWe want to draw a line between each of the points in the SVG but scaled to fit within the viewport.\nTo add another complication, the chart origin is in the bottom left, whereas the SVG origin is the top left.\nFor both the x and y axis, we want to scale down based upon the max value (width and height here are the chart width):\nx = x / max_x * width\ny = y / max_y * height\n\nFor the x axis, we need to shift them along the right based upon padding, otherwise they will sit on the left side of the svg:\nx = x / max_x * width + padding\n\nFor the y axis, we want to flip this based upon the height, to translate the origin, then add height + padding:\ny = y / max_y * (height * -1.0) + height + padding\n\nIterating through\nWe have our points commands, now let's iterate through and convert them to a bunch of draw commands.  First we will use M to move to start drawing, then we will use L to draw a line between each.\nWe can use enumerate() on the iterator to get whether this is the first or subsequent value, and then join it together as a big string:\nlet path = self\n    .points\n    .iter()\n    .map(|val| Point {\n        x: (val.x / max_x * width as f64) + padding as f64,\n        y: (val.y / max_y * (height as f64 * -1.0)) + (padding + height) as f64,\n    })\n    .enumerate()\n    .map(|(i, point)| {\n        if i == 0 {\n            format!(\"M {} {}\", point.x, point.y)\n        } else {\n            format!(\"L {} {}\", point.x, point.y)\n        }\n    })\n    .collect::&lt;Vec&lt;String&gt;&gt;().join(\" \");\n\nThis will output a path string like so:\nM 190 383.33333333333337 L 330 250 L 470 283.3333333333333 L 610 50 L 750 250\n\nAdding to the SVG\nWe can add the path &amp; colour to the Context:\ncontext.insert(\"path\", &amp;path);\ncontext.insert(\"colour\", &amp;self.colour);\n\nThen add the following to have it drawn in the SVG:\n&lt;path stroke=\"{{colour}}\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" d=\"{{path}}\" stroke-width=\"2.0\" fill=\"none\" /&gt;\n\nIf all goes well, the graph should start looking more like a graph:\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nAdding in the Axis\nWe need to add in some axis scale so we know what the graph values represent.  I'm gonna cheat here &amp; break up both the x and y axis the same amount of times each.  We'll break up the axis 5 times each, but have this set in the context to be changes later:\ncontext.insert(\"lines\", &amp;5);\n\nTera allows us to do a loop within the template, so we'll use that to add some lines and nudges.\n{% for i in range(end=(lines + 1)) %}\n... draw some lines here\n{% endfor %}\n\nLet's set some variables within the template, based upon the current line we're drawing.  These are the offsets for both the axis:\n{% set offset_x = padding + loop.index0/lines * width%}\n{% set offset_y = padding + loop.index0/lines * height%}\n\nHorizontal Lines\nWe will draw 5 horizontal dashed lines, to give scale to the y value.  This will start on the left side of the graph and continue to the end of the graph.  We'll draw a solid horizontal line when y = 0 (keep in mind the axis is flipped in SVG), which means we skip drawing this for the last line:\n{% if loop.last == false %}\n&lt;path stroke=\"#74838f\" stroke-dasharray=\"10 6\" stroke-width=\"0.5\"  d=\"M {{padding}} {{offset_y}} L {{width + padding}} {{offset_y}}\" /&gt;\n{% else %}\n&lt;path stroke=\"#74838f\" stroke-width=\"2\" fill=\"none\"  d=\"M {{padding}} {{offset_y}} L {{width + padding}} {{offset_y}}\" /&gt;\n{% endif %}\n\nNow our graph will be a bit easier to read:\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVertical Lines\nWe will just put little 10px nudges in the axis rather than dotted vertical lines.\nIn the existing for loop, we can add the following:\n&lt;path stroke=\"#74838f\" stroke-width=\"2.0\" d=\"M {{offset_x}} {{height + padding}} L {{offset_x}} {{height + padding + 10}}\" /&gt;\n\nThis will create nudges where we'll put our axis labels:\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAxis Labels\nWe can add in axis labels in the same for loop.\nFor the y-axis, the loop starts at the top of the graph and goes down, so we will use the following formula to present the 1/5th value:\n(lines - loop.index0)/lines * max_y\n\nWe can use the tera round helper to round the value up, so there is not a lot of decimal places:\n{{((lines - loop.index0)/lines * max_y) | round}}\n\nPutting this together:\n&lt;text\n  x=\"{{padding - 5}}\"\n  font-family=\"-apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, Roboto\"\n  y=\"{{offset_y}}\"\n  dominant-baseline=\"middle\"\n  text-anchor=\"end\"\n  font-size=\"12\"\n  fill=\"#74838f\"\n  font-weight=\"bold\"\n &gt;\n {{((lines - loop.index0)/lines * max_y) | round}}\n&lt;/text&gt;\n\nAnd quite similarly, the x-axis can be generated the same way (width y being fixed to where the nudge starts &amp; x being the offset):\n&lt;text\n  x=\"{{offset_x}}\"\n  font-family=\"-apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, Roboto\"\n  y=\"{{height + padding + 10}}\"\n  dominant-baseline=\"hanging\"\n  text-anchor=\"middle\"\n  font-size=\"12\"\n  fill=\"#74838f\"\n  font-weight=\"bold\"\n &gt;\n {{loop.index0/lines * max_x | round}}\n&lt;/text&gt;\n\nPutting this all together, we should have our labels in the right place:\n\n\n\nExample\n\n6\n0\n\n\n5\n1\n\n\n4\n2\n\n\n2\n3\n\n\n1\n4\n\n\n0\n5\n\n\n\n\nBonus: Smooth Lines\nOne trick I have found is that you can make simple smoth lines by treating the points as a Catmull-Rom spline, and then converting to Cubic Beziers, which SVG will draw happily.\nUsing this method, you can make your charts nice and smooth:\n\n\n\nExample\n\n6\n0\n\n\n5\n1\n\n\n4\n2\n\n\n2\n3\n\n\n1\n4\n\n\n0\n5\n\n\n\n\nSecond Bonus: Scuba Dive Graph\nI have also used a similar method to plot a dive, displaying the Depth and Air on a split axis, with my maximum depth displayed:\n\nConclusion\nWe used tera, as a template engine, to generate an SVG chart with rust.  Some basic geometry was needed, but the results show for themselves. I hope you have found this educational and gives you some ideas.\nAlso: try out lorikeet-dash and let me know what you think!\n","id":"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/drawing-svg-graphs-rust/","title":"Drawing SVG Graphs with Rust"},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/face-detection-with-actix-web/":{"body":"Last article I wrote about how to use tensorflow with rust.  This time we're going to take what we've built on, and serve it as an HTTP API call.  As Actix Web is nearing its inevitable 1.0 release, I thought it would be a great time to build something with it.\nThis article assumes you have some knowledge about Futures and how they work. I will do my best to explain in simpler terms, but understanding the futures ecosystem would be quite handy to help work through this article. For this, I suggest you start with tokio.\n(Some people have suggested waiting for async/await and friends to land before diving into Futures.  I think you should get your hands dirty now: async programming will always be challenging and the changes being introduced only affect ergonomics, not fundamentals)\nOnce again for the impatient, you can find the reference code here on the actix-web branch: \nhttps://github.com/cetra3/mtcnn/tree/actix-web\nAPI Shape\nThe API shape here is rather simple.  We want to emulate what we've done on the command line: Submit a picture, have a picture returned.  To make things interesting, we'll provide a way to return the bounding boxes as a JSON array too.\nFor submitting binary data via HTTP, there are a few options off the top of my head:\n\nSimply submit the raw data as it stands\nUse multipart/form-data\nEncode it as a JSON submission\n\nI think the easiest would be just the raw data so let's do that!  Multipart could possibly also work, but what about the case when you have to handle multiple images?  JSON Submission seems a bit wasteful, as you would inevitably have to convert binary data using base64 or similar.\nSo our API looks like this:\n\nSubmit POST request as a raw file submission\nRun a session against mtcnn to extract faces\nEither return Bounding Boxes as JSON, or an Image Overlay as a JPEG like the command line example\n\nMTCNN as a struct\nIn our last blog we just simply used the main function to perform everything, but it's not going to fly with actix until we do a bit of a refactor.  We want to encapsulate the mtcnn behaviour as a struct, something that can be passed around and moved.  The end goal is to use it in the application state.\nStruct Shape\nLet's make our struct include everything we need:\n\nThe Graph\nThe Session\nSome of the Tensor input params that don't change from request to request.\n\nWe'll start by creating a new file mtcnn.rs and adding in the struct definition.\nuse tensorflow::{Graph, Session, Tensor};\n\npub struct Mtcnn {\n    graph: Graph,\n    session: Session,\n    min_size: Tensor&lt;f32&gt;,\n    thresholds: Tensor&lt;f32&gt;,\n    factor: Tensor&lt;f32&gt;\n}\n\nOk, now we're just going to plop in the initiation stuff in a new() method.  As the creation of some of these values is not infallible, we'll return a Result:\npub fn new() -&gt; Result&lt;Self, Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;&gt; {\n\n    let model = include_bytes!(\"mtcnn.pb\");\n\n    let mut graph = Graph::new();\n    graph.import_graph_def(&amp;*model, &amp;ImportGraphDefOptions::new())?;\n\n    let session = Session::new(&amp;SessionOptions::new(), &amp;graph)?;\n\n    let min_size = Tensor::new(&amp;[]).with_values(&amp;[40f32])?;\n    let thresholds = Tensor::new(&amp;[3]).with_values(&amp;[0.6f32, 0.7f32, 0.7f32])?;\n    let factor = Tensor::new(&amp;[]).with_values(&amp;[0.709f32])?;\n\n    Ok(Self {\n        graph,\n        session,\n        min_size,\n        thresholds,\n        factor\n    })\n\n}\n\nThe Run Function\n(I'm going to race along here to get to the good parts, so if you get stuck or are unsure about what's going on, have a look at the original article for an explanation of what's happening here.)\nWe've added all the bits we need to run our session Let's create a method that does what we're asking the API to do: submit an image, return some bounding boxes:\npub fn run(&amp;self, img: &amp;DynamicImage) -&gt; Result&lt;Vec&lt;BBoxes&gt;, Status&gt; {\n    ...\n}\n\nOnce again, we are returning a Result as the type, as there are some parts of the run that can fail.  We're going to use the Status type as that is normally the error type returned\nLike our previous main function, we'll need to flatten the image input:\nlet input = {\n    let mut flattened: Vec&lt;f32&gt; = Vec::new();\n\n    for (_x, _y, rgb) in img.pixels() {\n        flattened.push(rgb[2] as f32);\n        flattened.push(rgb[1] as f32);\n        flattened.push(rgb[0] as f32);\n    }\n\n    Tensor::new(&amp;[img.height() as u64, img.width() as u64, 3])\n        .with_values(&amp;flattened)?\n};\n\nThen we'll feed in all the relevant inputs.  This is just the same as our previous main function, but we're going to just borrow values from self rather than create them for each run:\nlet mut args = SessionRunArgs::new();\n\nargs.add_feed(\n    &amp;self.graph.operation_by_name_required(\"min_size\")?,\n    0,\n    &amp;self.min_size,\n);\nargs.add_feed(\n    &amp;self.graph.operation_by_name_required(\"thresholds\")?,\n    0,\n    &amp;self.thresholds,\n);\nargs.add_feed(\n    &amp;self.graph.operation_by_name_required(\"factor\")?,\n    0,\n    &amp;self.factor,\n);\nargs.add_feed(&amp;self.graph.operation_by_name_required(\"input\")?, 0, &amp;input);\n\nNext, let's grab the outputs we want:\nlet bbox = args.request_fetch(&amp;self.graph.operation_by_name_required(\"box\")?, 0);\nlet prob = args.request_fetch(&amp;self.graph.operation_by_name_required(\"prob\")?, 0);\n\nRunning The Session\nNow we have all our args set up, we can run the session:\n&amp;self.session.run(&amp;mut args)?;\n\nUh oh.  We're getting a compiler error here... \nerror[E0596]: cannot borrow `self.session` as mutable, as it is behind a `&amp;` reference\n  --&gt; src/mtcnn.rs:68:10\n   |\n36 |     pub fn run(&amp;self, img: &amp;DynamicImage) -&gt; Result&lt;DynamicImage, Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;&gt; {\n   |                ----- help: consider changing this to be a mutable reference: `&amp;mut self`\n...\n68 |         &amp;self.session.run(&amp;mut args)?;\n   |          ^^^^^^^^^^^^ `self` is a `&amp;` reference, so the data it refers to cannot be borrowed as mutable\n\nTurns out that the Session::run() function takes &amp;mut self.\nWhat can we do to resolve this:\n\nMake our run function take &amp;mut self so we can mutate the field\nDo some tricky interior mutability\nSubmit an issue on the tensorflow-rust crate to see whether Session really needs to take &amp;mut self.\n\nWe'll go with option 3!\nUpdate your Cargo.toml to point to the git master, rather than the cargo version:\ntensorflow = { git = \"https://github.com/tensorflow/rust\"}\n\nGetting the Bounding Boxes\nThis has not changed at all since our main method.  We grab the bounding boxes, put them in our handy dandy BBox struct:\n//Our bounding box extents\nlet bbox_res: Tensor&lt;f32&gt; = args.fetch(bbox)?;\n//Our facial probability\nlet prob_res: Tensor&lt;f32&gt; = args.fetch(prob)?;\n\n//Let's store the results as a Vec&lt;BBox&gt;\nlet mut bboxes = Vec::new();\n\nlet mut i = 0;\nlet mut j = 0;\n\n//While we have responses, iterate through\nwhile i &lt; bbox_res.len() {\n    //Add in the 4 floats from the `bbox_res` array.\n    //Notice the y1, x1, etc.. is ordered differently to our struct definition.\n    bboxes.push(BBox {\n        y1: bbox_res[i],\n        x1: bbox_res[i + 1],\n        y2: bbox_res[i + 2],\n        x2: bbox_res[i + 3],\n        prob: prob_res[j], // Add in the facial probability\n    });\n\n    //Step `i` ahead by 4.\n    i += 4;\n    //Step `i` ahead by 1.\n    j += 1;\n}\n\ndebug!(\"BBox Length: {}, BBoxes:{:#?}\", bboxes.len(), bboxes);\n\nOk(bboxes)\n\nAnd that's our run function finished.\nBBox Struct as JSON\nWe're gonna want to return a JSON representation of the BBox struct.  So let's add in serde_derive:\nuse serde_derive::Serialize;\n\n#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, Serialize)]\npub struct BBox {\n    pub x1: f32,\n    pub y1: f32,\n    pub x2: f32,\n    pub y2: f32,\n    pub prob: f32,\n}\n\nDrawing the Output Image\nWe'll create a function that will take a list of bounding boxes and an input image, returning the output image:\npub fn overlay(img: &amp;DynamicImage, bboxes: &amp;Vec&lt;BBox&gt;) -&gt; DynamicImage\n\nThis hasn't changed much either, but we are returning the image, rather than saving it to a file:\n//Let's clone the input image\nlet mut output_image = img.clone();\n\n//Iterate through all bounding boxes\nfor bbox in bboxes {\n    //Create a `Rect` from the bounding box.\n    let rect = Rect::at(bbox.x1 as i32, bbox.y1 as i32)\n        .of_size((bbox.x2 - bbox.x1) as u32, (bbox.y2 - bbox.y1) as u32);\n\n    //Draw a green line around the bounding box\n    draw_hollow_rect_mut(&amp;mut output_image, rect, LINE_COLOUR);\n}\n\noutput_image\n\nOk, we're pretty much done with our Mtcnn struct and functions! Could we break this down even further? Yeah definitely! But for now, I think this is all we need.  We've encapsulated the behaviour and created a nice to use couple of functions.\nOur New Main Function\nOk, so we're no longer using it as a CLI, but as a self-hosted web app.  We're going to need to change the arguments our application takes since we no longer have input and output files.\nI think the only argument we should be taking initially is the listen address, and even then we should use a sensible default. So let's use the help of structopt to make this pretty minimal boilerplate:\n#[derive(StructOpt)]\nstruct Opt {\n    #[structopt(\n        short = \"l\",\n        long = \"listen\",\n        help = \"Listen Address\",\n        default_value = \"127.0.0.1:8000\"\n    )]\n    listen: String,\n}\n\nLogging Framework\nActix Web uses the log crate to display errors and debug messages.\nLet's move on from using println! and instead use log.  I like using pretty_env_logger as it prints different levels as a different colour, and we can have timestamps which is useful.\npretty_env_logger still uses environment vars.  Let's cheat and set our RUST_LOG var if none is provided then initiate our logger\n//Set the `RUST_LOG` var if none is provided\nif env::var(\"RUST_LOG\").is_err() {\n    env::set_var(\"RUST_LOG\", \"mtcnn=DEBUG,actix_web=DEBUG\");\n}\n\n//Create a timestamped logger\npretty_env_logger::init_timed();\n\nThis sets up DEBUG level logs for our app and actix web, but allows us to change the log levels via environment variables still.\nActix and State\nWe have some state we need to pass to actix to use: our Mtcnn struct and the run method.  There are a number of ways you can give State to actix, but probably the easiest way is the App::data method.  As we are now entering a multithreaded world, we're going to have to think about what things are Send and Sync.\nOk, so how do we share something between threads? Well, as a first step I would look to std::sync to see what we need.  Since we know that mtcnn's run function does not need to mutate it, only requiring a reference to immutable self, we can probably wrap it in an Arc.  If we had to mutate it, then it would probably require a Mutex as well, but we can avoid this if we use the master branch of tensorflow-rust as above.\nSo let's create our Arc:\nlet mtcnn = Arc::new(Mtcnn::new()?);\n\nNow, to instantiate the server:\nHttpServer::new(move || {\n    App::new()\n        //Add in our mtcnn struct, we clone the reference for each worker thread\n        .data(mtcnn.clone())\n        //Add in a logger to see the requests coming through\n        .wrap(middleware::Logger::default())\n        // Add in some routes here\n        .service(\n            ...\n        )\n})\n.bind(&amp;opt.listen)? // Use the listener from the command arguments\n.run()\n\nOk, let's step through what we're doing:\n\nWe first build a HttpServer\nThis takes a closure which should return an App.  This App is instantiated for each thread the http server is running\nWe add our Arc&lt;Mtcnn&gt; using the data method, and clone it for each thread listener.\nWe add a logger middleware.\nWe set up some routes with the service function\nThen we bind to a listen address and run\n\nHandling a Request\nActix Web is an Async framework and uses tokio.  Our function is Synchronous and takes some time to complete.\nIn other words, our request is blocking.  Can we mix and match sync and async? Absolutely, but it is a little more cumbersome as you'll see.\nFunction Signature and Extractors\nActix 1.0 makes heavy use of Extractors, which is a way of providing functions of quite different shapes.  You basically specify what you want your web function to receive, and actix will wire it up for you.  Take care though:  This does mean that some things won't be discovered wrong until runtime.  A perfect example I had when I used the wrong type signature for the web::Data argument.\nSo what do we need to extract from our request? The bytes of the request body, and and also our mtcnn:\nfn handle_request(\n    stream: web::Payload,\n    mtcnn: web::Data&lt;Arc&lt;Mtcnn&gt;&gt;,\n) -&gt; impl Future&lt;Item = HttpResponse, Error = ActixError&gt; {\n\n    ...\n\n}\n\nWe will use this type signature for mtcnn a fair bit, so let's make a type alias for it:\ntype WebMtcnn = web::Data&lt;Arc&lt;Mtcnn&gt;&gt;;\n\nGetting the Image from a Payload\nOk, so we need a way of retrieving the image from a payload and returning a Future.  The web::Payload struct implements Stream with Item set to Bytes.\nWell, we don't really care about the individual bytes we get from a stream, we want the whole lot to decode the image!  So let's convert the Stream into a Future, and merge all the individual bytes we'll be getting into one big bucket of bytes.  Sounds complicated, but luckily Stream has a method: concat2. \nThis is a pretty powerful combinator which allows us to join the results of individual Stream polls into one if the item implements Extend (and some other traits) which Bytes happens to.\nSo this looks like:\nstream.concat2().and_then(....)\n\nImage Decoding and web::block\nOk, second thing we need to sort out, if we're going to be decoding an image, that is probably going to block the thread until it's done.  How long? Well if it's a huge image, it might take milliseconds!  So we want to ensure that we're not blocking the http workers while this is happening.  Luckily, actix web has a way of taking a blocking portion of code, and wrapping that as a future.\nEnter web::block.  We'll do our decoding in a cpu pool, bridging sync and async together:\nstream.concat2().and_then(move |bytes| {\n    web::block(move || {\n        image::load_from_memory(&amp;bytes)\n    })\n})\n\nOk, that is pretty succint: we take a stream, convert it into a future and a bundle of bytes, then use web::block to decode the bytes into an image in a background thread and return the result.  the load_from_memory function already returns a Result, which means we can just use that as the return type.\nBalancing the Error Type\nSo, our Item is converted to Bytes to DynamicImage, but we still haven't dealt with the error types yet and it won't compile.  What should our error type be?  Let's use actix_web::Error as ActixError:\nuse actix_web::{Error as ActixError}\n\nfn get_image(stream: web::Payload) -&gt; impl Future&lt;Item = DynamicImage, Error = ActixError&gt; {\n    stream.concat2().and_then(move |bytes| {\n        web::block(move || {\n            image::load_from_memory(&amp;bytes)\n        })\n    })\n}\n\nOk, that is giving us few really gnarly errors when we try and compile it:\nerror[E0271]: type mismatch resolving `&lt;impl futures::future::Future as futures::future::IntoFuture&gt;::Error == actix_http::error::PayloadError`\n  --&gt; src/main.rs:67:22\n   |\n67 |     stream.concat2().and_then(move |bytes| {\n   |                      ^^^^^^^^ expected enum `actix_threadpool::BlockingError`, found enum `actix_http::error::PayloadError`\n   |\n   = note: expected type `actix_threadpool::BlockingError&lt;image::image::ImageError&gt;`\n              found type `actix_http::error::PayloadError`\n\nThere's a couple more that aren't listed.\nWhen you are combining streams, mapping them as futures, and otherwise trying to get some output from these combinators you are actually dealing with both the Item type, and the Error type.\nThe ergonomics of this are not as advanced as the Result type, where we can use the ? operator to automatically adjust to the right error (if a conversion is available). When both ops::Try and async/await syntax stabilises, this might be a different story, but for now, we need to deal with error types.\nWhat we have instead is the magic™️ from_err() method.  This is basically the same as the ? operator but for futures.  We have two futures we're dealing with: our bundle of bytes from the stream, and the image from the blocking closure. We have 3 error types we're dealing with: the Payload error, the Image load from memory error, and the blocking error.\nLet's start by putting from_err() on both of the futures:\nfn get_image(stream: web::Payload)\n  -&gt; impl Future&lt;Item = DynamicImage, Error = ActixError&gt; {\n    stream.concat2().from_err().and_then(move |bytes| {\n        web::block(move || {\n            image::load_from_memory(&amp;bytes)\n        }).from_err()\n    })\n}\n\nThat worked! There is enough conversions for our error types to get to where we need to get it.  The ActixError type has a few blanket conversions from common error types enough to be able to make this magic happen.\nGetting the bounding boxes from the image\nAt the core of it, we need to run the following:\nmtcnn.run(&amp;img)\n\nBut we want this to run in a threadpool too:\nweb::block(|| mtcnn.run(&amp;img))\n\nLet's work through the function signature we'll need.  At a minimum we're gonna need the image, and the mtcnn struct.  Then we want to return a Vec of BBoxes.  We should try and keep our error types the same, so we'll use the ActixError type.\nThe function signature looks like this:\nfn get_bboxes(img: DynamicImage, mtcnn: WebMtcnn) \n  -&gt; impl Future&lt;Item = Vec&lt;BBox&gt;, Error = ActixError&gt; \n\nWe know that we'll need a from_err() on the web::block to convert the error type, and we'll have to use a move to give the image to the closure:\nfn get_bboxes(img: DynamicImage, mtcnn: WebMtcnn) -&gt; impl Future&lt;Item = Vec&lt;BBox&gt;, Error = ActixError&gt; {\n    web::block(move || mtcnn.run(&amp;img)).from_err()\n}\n\nBut does this compile? Not yet:\nerror[E0277]: `*mut tensorflow_sys::TF_Status` cannot be sent between threads safely\n  --&gt; src/main.rs:75:5\n   |\n75 |     web::block(move || mtcnn.run(&amp;img)).from_err()\n   |     ^^^^^^^^^^ `*mut tensorflow_sys::TF_Status` cannot be sent between threads safely\n   |\n   = help: within `tensorflow::Status`, the trait `std::marker::Send` is not implemented for `*mut tensorflow_sys::TF_Status`\n   = note: required because it appears within the type `tensorflow::Status`\n   = note: required by `actix_web::web::block`\n\ntensorflow::Status, which is the error type, can't be sent between threads.\nLet's just shortcut here, and convert the error to a String:\nfn get_bboxes(img: DynamicImage, mtcnn: WebMtcnn) -&gt; impl Future&lt;Item = Vec&lt;BBox&gt;, Error = ActixError&gt; {\n    web::block(move || mtcnn.run(&amp;img).map_err(|e| e.to_string())).from_err()\n}\n\nThis allows us to move the Result across thread boundaries, as String does implement Send\nReturning JSON BBoxes\nOk, so we have 2 functions, one to get the image from the request, and one to get the bounding boxes.  We're gonna want to return json HttpResponse:\nfn return_bboxes(\n    stream: web::Payload,\n    mtcnn: WebMtcnn,\n) -&gt; impl Future&lt;Item = HttpResponse, Error = ActixError&gt; {\n    // Get the image from the input stream\n    get_image(stream) \n        // Get the bounding boxes from the image\n        .and_then(move |img| get_bboxes(img, mtcnn)) \n        // Map the bounding boxes to a json HttpResponse\n        .map(|bboxes| HttpResponse::Ok().json(bboxes))\n}\n\nCool! Let's put this in our App definition:\nHttpServer::new(move || {\n    App::new()\n        .data(mtcnn.clone()) \n        .wrap(middleware::Logger::default()) \n        // our new API service\n        .service(web::resource(\"/api/v1/bboxes\").to_async(return_bboxes))\n})\n.bind(&amp;opt.listen)?\n.run()\n\nAnd let's run it, using curl to submit a query to get some results back\n$ curl --data-binary @rustfest.jpg  http://localhost:8000/api/v1/bboxes\n\n[{\"x1\":471.4591,\"y1\":287.59888,\"x2\":495.3053,\"y2\":317.25327,\"prob\":0.9999908}....\n\nAwesome! Using jmespath to see we get our 120 faces back:\n$ curl -s --data-binary @rustfest.jpg  http://localhost:8000/api/v1/bboxes | jp \"length(@)\"\n120\n\nReturning an Overlay Image\nThe other API call we want is to return an image with the bounding boxes overlayed.  This is not much of a stretch, but the act of drawing boxes on an image is definitely a blocking action, so we'll need to do the same thing and send it to a thread pool.\nLet's wrap our overlay function, converting it into a Future:\nfn get_overlay(img: DynamicImage, bboxes: Vec&lt;BBox&gt;)\n   -&gt; impl Future&lt;Item = Vec&lt;u8&gt;, Error = ActixError&gt; {\n    web::block(move || {\n        let output_img = overlay(&amp;img, &amp;bboxes);\n        \n        ...\n\n    }).from_err()\n}\n\nWe're going to want to return a Vec of u8 bytes so we can use this in the return body. So we'll need to allocate some buffer and instruct image to write out a JPEG from the image:\nlet mut buffer = vec![];\n\noutput_img.write_to(&amp;mut buffer, JPEG)?; // write out our buffer\n\nOk(buffer)\n\nOk, so let's put our little function together and see if it compiles:\nfn get_overlay(img: DynamicImage, bboxes: Vec&lt;BBox&gt;)\n  -&gt; impl Future&lt;Item = Vec&lt;u8&gt;, Error = ActixError&gt; {\n    web::block(move || {\n        let output_img = overlay(&amp;img, &amp;bboxes);\n\n        let mut buffer = Vec::new();\n\n        output_img.write_to(&amp;mut buffer, JPEG)?; // write out our buffer\n\n        Ok(buffer)\n    }).from_err()\n}\n\nNot quite yet: we're missing a type annotation:\nerror[E0282]: type annotations needed\n  --&gt; src/main.rs:82:5\n   |\n82 |     web::block(move || {\n   |     ^^^^^^^^^^ cannot infer type for `E`\n\nWhy is there an issue with the type? Well, it relates to this line here:\nOk(buffer) // What's the `Error` type here?\n\nAt the moment, the only error type is from the write_to method which is ImageError.  But this line here doesn't have an error type, and could be anything.\nThere are 3 ways I can immediately think to handle this:\nWay Number 1: Declare the error type in web::block\nweb::block::&lt;_,_,ImageError&gt;\n\nThis looks more like a turbosubmarine than a turbofish! But it compiles!\nWay Number 2: Declare the Result type with as \nOk(buffer) as Result&lt;_, ImageError&gt;\n\nWay Number 3: Use map to return the buffer on success:\noutput_img.write_to(&amp;mut buffer, JPEG).map(|_| buffer)\n\nI think for readability, #2 is probably easiest.  The web::block function takes 3 type arguments which can be confusing on first read of the code.  #3 is good too but I think it looks a bit strange.\nOur final method looks like:\nfn get_overlay(img: DynamicImage, bboxes: Vec&lt;BBox&gt;)\n   -&gt; impl Future&lt;Item = Vec&lt;u8&gt;, Error = ActixError&gt; {\n    web::block(move || {\n        let output_img = overlay(&amp;img, &amp;bboxes);\n\n        let mut buffer = Vec::new();\n\n        output_img.write_to(&amp;mut buffer, JPEG)?;\n\n        // Type annotations required for the `web::block`\n        Ok(buffer) as Result&lt;_, ImageError&gt; \n    }).from_err()\n}\n\nThe API call\nOk, we have our little futures that we need to return bounding boxes and image overlays.  Let's stitch this together and return a HttpResponse:\nfn return_overlay(\n    stream: web::Payload,\n    mtcnn: WebMtcnn,\n) -&gt; impl Future&lt;Item = HttpResponse, Error = ActixError&gt; {\n    //... magic happens here\n}\n\nOk, first step is to get the image from the stream:\nget_image(stream)\n\nAnd Then once the future has resolved, we want to get the bounding boxes:\nget_image(stream).and_then(move |img| {\n    get_bboxes(img, mtcnn)\n})\n\nMoving Images Around\nNow we want to get the image overlay.  We have an issue though! we give the get_bboxes future our image, and it returns a Vec of bboxes, consuming the image.  There are a couple of options here.  We could clone() the image when we give it to bboxes, but that is duplicating memory.  We could wait for Pin and async/await to be finished and probably deal with it in an easier way then.\nOr we could adjust our get_bboxes method to return a tuple of both the image and bounding boxes:\nfn get_bboxes(\n    img: DynamicImage,\n    mtcnn: WebMtcnn,\n) -&gt; impl Future&lt;Item = (DynamicImage, Vec&lt;BBox&gt;), Error = ActixError&gt; {\n    web::block(move || {\n        mtcnn\n            .run(&amp;img)\n            .map_err(|e| e.to_string())\n            //Return both the image and the bounding boxes\n            .map(|bboxes| (img, bboxes))\n    })\n    .from_err()\n}\n\nMaking sure to update our return_bboxes function too:\nfn return_bboxes(\n    stream: web::Payload,\n    mtcnn: WebMtcnn,\n) -&gt; impl Future&lt;Item = HttpResponse, Error = ActixError&gt; {\n    get_image(stream)\n        .and_then(move |img| get_bboxes(img, mtcnn))\n        .map(|(_img, bboxes)| HttpResponse::Ok().json(bboxes))\n}\n\nGetting the Overlay\nIt would be great if rust could desugar a tuple into command arguments.  Unfortunately not for us, so we will need to create a small closure:\n//Create our image overlay\n.and_then(|(img, bbox)| get_overlay(img, bbox))\n.map(|buffer| {\n// Return a `HttpResponse` here\n})\n\nGenerating the Response\nOur HttpResponse needs to wrap the buffer into a Http Request with the buffer as the body:\nHttpResponse::with_body(StatusCode::OK, buffer.into())\n\nIs that it? Well no, we have to set the content type header to be a jpeg:\nlet mut response = HttpResponse::with_body(StatusCode::OK, buffer.into());\n\nresponse\n    .headers_mut()\n    .insert(CONTENT_TYPE, HeaderValue::from_static(\"image/jpeg\"));\n\nOk now we can return the result:\nfn return_overlay(\n    stream: web::Payload,\n    mtcnn: WebMtcnn,\n) -&gt; impl Future&lt;Item = HttpResponse, Error = ActixError&gt; {\n    get_image(stream)\n        .and_then(move |img| {\n            get_bboxes(img, mtcnn)\n        })\n        .and_then(|(img, bbox) | get_overlay(img, bbox))\n        .map(|buffer| {\n            let mut response = HttpResponse::with_body(StatusCode::OK, buffer.into());\n            response\n                .headers_mut()\n                .insert(CONTENT_TYPE, HeaderValue::from_static(\"image/jpeg\"));\n            response\n        })\n}\n\nAnd add that to our App builder:\nHttpServer::new(move || {\n    App::new()\n        .data(mtcnn.clone()) //Add in our data handler\n        //Add in a logger to see the requets coming through\n        .wrap(middleware::Logger::default()) \n        //JSON bounding boxes\n        .service(web::resource(\"/api/v1/bboxes\").to_async(return_bboxes))\n        //Image overlay\n        .service(web::resource(\"/api/v1/overlay\").to_async(return_overlay))\n}\n\nGreat! Let's run it:\n$ curl --data-binary @rustfest.jpg  http://localhost:8000/api/v1/bboxes &gt; output.jpg\n\nAnd we have our original overlay!\n\nConclusions\nWe stepped through converting a CLI app into a HTTP service, dipping our toes into the brave new async world.\nAs you can see, actix web is a very versatile web framework.  My interest in it was borne out of having all the features I need to build up web apps: multipart, thread pools, great efficiency.\nWhile it is hard to bridge the sync and async gap, it's not impossible.  It would be great if there were some more ergonomic ways to do so, as I think a lot of developers struggle with this: I have seen a lot of questions around integrating with diesel and friends.\nIf you are looking for more actix web examples, the evergrowing examples repo is your best bet:\nhttps://github.com/actix/examples\nI look forward to seeing what the community builds in the future!\n","id":"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/face-detection-with-actix-web/","title":"Face Detection with Actix Web"},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/face-detection-with-tensorflow-rust/":{"body":"One of the promises of machine learning is to be able to use it for object recognition in photos.  This includes being able to pick out features such as animals, buildings and even faces.\nThis article will step you through using some existing models to accomplish face detection using rust and tensorflow.  For the impatient among you, you can find the source code here: https://github.com/cetra3/mtcnn\nWe will be using a pre-trained model called mtcnn for face detection (Note: training a new model is not something we'll be concerned with in this article).\nThe Challenge\nWe want to read the photo, have the faces detected, and then return an image with the bounding boxes drawn in.\nIn other words, we want to convert this (Image used with permission of RustFest, taken by Fiona Castiñeira):\n\nInto this:\n\nTensorflow and MTCNN\nThe original MTCNN model was written using Caffe, but luckily there is a number of tensorflow python implementations for mtcnn.  I'm going to pick the following as it is a straight conversion into a single graph model file.\nFirstly we want to add tensorflow rust as a dependency.  Here's a Cargo.toml to start:\n[package]\nname = \"mtcnn\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nedition = \"2018\"\n\n[dependencies]\ntensorflow = \"0.12.0\"\n\nWhat we're going to do is load a Graph which is the pre-trained MTCNN, and run a session.  The gist is that a Graph is the model used for computation, and a Session is one run of the Graph.  A lot more information about these concepts can be found here.  I like to think of the Graph as an artificial brain in a vat, just to get some great imagery when you start plugging in inputs and outputs.\nSo let's start by grabbing the existing mtcnn.pb model and trying to load it up.  Tensorflow graphs are serialised out in protobuf format and can be loaded in using Graph::import_graph_def.\nuse std::error::Error;\n\nuse tensorflow::Graph;\nuse tensorflow::ImportGraphDefOptions;\n\nfn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;&gt; {\n\n    //First, we load up the graph as a byte array\n    let model = include_bytes!(\"mtcnn.pb\");\n\n    //Then we create a tensorflow graph from the model\n    let mut graph = Graph::new();\n    graph.import_graph_def(&amp;*model, &amp;ImportGraphDefOptions::new())?\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n\nRunning cargo run we should see no errors:\n$ cargo run\n   Compiling mtcnn v0.1.0 (~/mtcnn)\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.89s\n     Running `target/debug/mtcnn`\n\nGreat! Looks like we can load the graph!\nStructOpt and the Command Line\nWe're going to want to test out image generation, so let's use structopt to take two arguments: input and output.\nIf you haven't used structopt before: structopt is like combining clap with serde.  The input argument will be the path of an image file.  The output will be where we save the output image.\nSo our struct looks like this:\nuse std::path::PathBuf;\nuse structopt::StructOpt\n\n#[derive(StructOpt)]\nstruct Opt {\n    #[structopt(parse(from_os_str))]\n    input: PathBuf,\n\n    #[structopt(parse(from_os_str))]\n    output: PathBuf\n}\n\nThe parse(from_os_str) attribute will convert a string argument directly into a PathBuf to save us some boiler plate\nWe can then use this to get a struct with our command line arguments\nfn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;&gt; {\n\n    let opt = Opt::from_args();\n    ....\n}\n\nLoading Image Data\nWe need to provide the tensorflow graph with our image data.  So how do we do that? We use a Tensor!  Tensors represent data within our graph, it sort of reminds me of sending vertices to a GPU.  You have a big slice of data, and send it in a format that tensorflow is expecting.\nThe input tensor in this graph is an array of floats, with dimensions: height x width x 3 (for 3 colour channels).\nLet's use the image crate to load the image:\nlet input_image = image::open(&amp;opt.input)?;\n\nNext we want to convert this image into its raw pixels by using the GenericImage::pixels function and send that to our graph. All multi-dimensional Tensor arrays are flat, and stored in row major order.  The model uses BGR instead of the traditional RGB for colours, so we'll need to reverse the pixel values when we iterate through.\nPutting it all together:\nlet mut flattened: Vec&lt;f32&gt; = Vec::new();\n\nfor (_x, _y, rgb) in input_image.pixels() {\n    flattened.push(rgb[2] as f32);\n    flattened.push(rgb[1] as f32);\n    flattened.push(rgb[0] as f32);\n}\n\nThis simply iterates through the pixels, adding them to a flattened Vec.\nWe can then load this into a tensor, specifying the image height and width as arguments:\nlet input = Tensor::new(&amp;[input_image.height() as u64, input_image.width() as u64, 3])\n    .with_values(&amp;flattened)?\n\nGreat! we have loaded our image into a format that the graph understands.  Let's run a session!\nCreating a tensorflow session\nOk, we have a graph, the input image, but now we need a session for the graph.  We'll just use the defaults for this:\nlet session = Session::new(&amp;SessionOptions::new(), &amp;graph)?;\n\nRunning a session\nBefore we run a session, we have a few other inputs the mtcnn model is expecting.  We're gonna use the same defaults the mtcnn library for these values:\nlet min_size = Tensor::new(&amp;[]).with_values(&amp;[40f32])?;\nlet thresholds = Tensor::new(&amp;[3]).with_values(&amp;[0.6f32, 0.7f32, 0.7f32])?;\nlet factor = Tensor::new(&amp;[]).with_values(&amp;[0.709f32])?;\n\nThe graph can define multiple inputs/outputs that are required before running and it depends on the specific neural net as to what these are.  For MTCNN, these are all described in the original implementation.  Probably the most important one is the min_size which describes the minimum size to find faces.\nNow we build the session arguments for the inputs:\nlet mut args = SessionRunArgs::new();\n\n//Load our parameters for the model\nargs.add_feed(&amp;graph.operation_by_name_required(\"min_size\")?, 0, &amp;min_size);\nargs.add_feed(&amp;graph.operation_by_name_required(\"thresholds\")?, 0, &amp;thresholds);\nargs.add_feed(&amp;graph.operation_by_name_required(\"factor\")?, 0, &amp;factor);\n\n//Load our input image\nargs.add_feed(&amp;graph.operation_by_name_required(\"input\")?, 0, &amp;input);\n\nOk, what about outputs? There are two that we are going to request when the session is finished: bounding boxes and probabilities:\nlet bbox = args.request_fetch(&amp;graph.operation_by_name_required(\"box\")?, 0);\nlet prob = args.request_fetch(&amp;graph.operation_by_name_required(\"prob\")?, 0);\n\nOk cool, we have our inputs, and our outputs, let's run it!\nsession.run(&amp;mut args)?;\n\nThe BBox struct\nThe model outputs the following values:\n\nBounding box of the faces\nLandmarks of the faces\nProbability that it's a face from 0 to 1\n\nIn order to make it a bit more easy to work with, we'll define a bounding box struct which encodes those values back in a more easy to read fashion:\n#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug)]\npub struct BBox {\n    pub x1: f32,\n    pub y1: f32,\n    pub x2: f32,\n    pub y2: f32,\n    pub prob: f32,\n}\n\nWe'll omit landmarks for simplicity, but can always add them back if we need.  Our job is to convert the arrays we get back from the tensorflow session into this struct so it's more meaningful.\nSaving the Output\nRight, now let's grab back the outputs.  Just like inputs, outputs are Tensors too:\nlet bbox_res: Tensor&lt;f32&gt; = args.fetch(bbox)?;\nlet prob_res: Tensor&lt;f32&gt; = args.fetch(prob)?;\n\nWhat is the shape of bbox? Well, it's a multi-dimensional flattened array that includes 4 floats per bounding box representing the bounding box extents.  The prob is an array with a single float value per face: the probability from 0 to 1.  So we should expect the bbox_res length to be the number of faces x 4, and prob_res to be equal to the number of faces.\nLet's do some basic iteration and store our results into a Vec:\n\n//Let's store the results as a Vec&lt;BBox&gt;\nlet mut bboxes = Vec::new();\n\nlet mut i = 0;\nlet mut j = 0;\n\n//While we have responses, iterate through\nwhile i &lt; bbox_res.len() {\n\n    //Add in the 4 floats from the `bbox_res` array. \n    //Notice the y1, x1, etc.. is ordered differently to our struct definition.\n    bboxes.push(BBox {\n        y1: bbox_res[i],\n        x1: bbox_res[i + 1],\n        y2: bbox_res[i + 2],\n        x2: bbox_res[i + 3],\n        prob: prob_res[j], // Add in the facial probability\n    });\n\n    //Step `i` ahead by 4. \n    i += 4;\n    //Step `i` ahead by 1. \n    j += 1;\n}\n\nCombinators\nAlternatively, we could use combinators to replace the one above.\nlet bboxes: Vec&lt;_&gt; = bbox_res\n    .chunks_exact(4) // Split into chunks of 4\n    .zip(prob_res.iter()) // Combine it with prob_res\n    .map(|(bbox, &amp;prob)| BBox {\n        y1: bbox[0],\n        x1: bbox[1],\n        y2: bbox[2],\n        x2: bbox[3],\n        prob,\n    })\n    .collect();\n\nPrinting out the bounding boxes\nOk, we haven't encoded the bounding boxes into an image, yet. but let's debug to make sure we're getting back something:\nprintln!(\"BBox Length: {}, Bboxes:{:#?}\", bboxes.len(), bboxes);\n\nRunning this, what do we get back:\nBBox Length: 120, BBoxes:[\n    BBox {\n        x1: 471.4591,\n        y1: 287.59888,\n        x2: 495.3053,\n        y2: 317.25327,\n        prob: 0.9999908\n    },\n    ....\n\nWhoa! 120 faces! Awesome!\nDrawing the Bounding Boxes\nGreat, we have some bounding boxes.  Let's draw them on the image, and save the output into a file.\nTo draw bounding boxes, we can use the imageproc library to draw simple borders around the bounding boxes.\nFirstly, we'll make the line colour constant green outside of our main() function:\nconst LINE_COLOUR: Rgba&lt;u8&gt; = Rgba {\n        data: [0, 255, 0, 0],\n};\n\nNow stepping back into it.  We are feeding in the input image read only, so let's use the first image to draw onto:\nlet mut output_image = input_image;\n\nThen we iterate through our bounding boxes:\nfor bbox in bboxes {\n    //Drawing Happens Here!\n}\n\nNext, we use the draw_hollow_rect_mut function.  This will take a mutable image reference, and draw a hollow rectangle (outline) specified by the input Rect, overwriting any existing pixels.\nThe Rect takes an x and y coordinate with the at function, and then a width and height with the of_size function.  We use a bit of geometry to convert our bounding box to this format:\nlet rect = Rect::at(bbox.x1 as i32, bbox.y1 as i32)\n    .of_size((bbox.x2 - bbox.x1) as u32, (bbox.y2 - bbox.y1) as u32);\n\nThen draw the rect:\ndraw_hollow_rect_mut(&amp;mut output_image, rect, LINE_COLOUR);\n\nOnce the for loop is done, we save it in the output file:\noutput_image.save(&amp;opt.output)?;\n\nAnd we're done.

I wanted to give it a bit of a test run and see how easy it would be to convert usage from tokio-postgres.  So as the next saga in the jobq series (part 1, part 2), we will be converting jobq crate to use sqlx.  You can find the SQLx branch here: https://github.com/cetra3/jobq/tree/sqlx\nAs a little spoiler: I found it quite easy to adjust and a pleasure to use but found the documentation a little lacking.\nObject Relational Mappers (ORMs)\nORMs definitely serve a purpose. ORMs provide an opinionated way to manage the database schema and craft queries in an easy way.  Normally you construct queries using builders, or other language constructs, and get given the results back straight in your language types (structs in the case of rust).  Migration is a lot easier as most offer a managed way to run migrations for you.  You don't need to know SQL either, and can simply run functions in your language to build up queries to the database.\nWriting raw SQL in some ORMs is a second class citizen, which is where I have a problem.  I personally find the cognitive load of having to wrangle the builder pattern to pull out SQL is not worth it.  I am quite comfortable writing SQL and have done for many years, and so I have steered away from using highly opinionated ORMs in the past.  In the world of Java I much prefer MyBatis or Jdbi over Hibernate.  In Rust, I am using standard tokio-postgres over diesel for the same reasons (that: and diesel async support is not there yet and doesn't look like it will be anytime soon...).\nNow if you are not familiar with SQL this is definitely a different story, and may find you have a different opinion on how productive you are.  That's fine too, as this is one reason ORMs exist: to make it easier to code.  I would still recommend spending time grokking SQL, as it is quite a great skill to have in your toolbox.\nDiesel ORM\nPicking on diesel for a second: here is their Complex Queries example:\nlet versions = Version::belonging_to(krate)\n  .select(id)\n  .order(num.desc())\n  .limit(5);\nlet downloads = version_downloads\n  .filter(date.gt(now - 90.days()))\n  .filter(version_id.eq(any(versions)))\n  .order(date)\n  .load::&lt;Download&gt;(&amp;conn)?;\n\nHere is the same query in SQL:\nSELECT version_downloads.*\n  WHERE date &gt; (NOW() - '90 days')\n    AND version_id = ANY(\n      SELECT id FROM versions\n        WHERE crate_id = 1\n        ORDER BY num DESC\n        LIMIT 5\n    )\n  ORDER BY date\n\nWhich one do you find more readable? I find the SQL easier to read.\nSQLx ORM\nI still consider SQLx an ORM, but with SQL as a first-class citizen.\nHere's how you'd do the same with SQLx:\nlet query = \"SELECT version_downloads.*\n  WHERE date &gt; (NOW() - '90 days')\n    AND version_id = ANY(\n      SELECT id FROM versions\n        WHERE crate_id = $1\n        ORDER BY num DESC\n        LIMIT 5\n    )\n  ORDER BY date\";\n\n\nsqlx::query_as(query)\n    .bind(&amp;num)\n    .fetch_all(&amp;*self.pool);\n\nIf your Version struct derived sqlx::FromRow, then this would all work nicely.\nConverting to SQLx\nConverting to SQLx was a mostly painless experience, and only very minimal changes were needed for the jobq code base.  In the end, only the structs &amp; db files were needed to be adjusted, but I could reuse all of the query strings and sql building logic.\nAs I am not starting with SQLx, some of the touted features I didn't use (like compile time verification).  There were also a few gotchas I ran into, but did not find it hard to work through them after a bit of reading.\nMigrations and Raw SQL\nI haven't implemented migrations properly in jobq: it's just a simple sql script that is run at startup.  SQLx does have utilities for this, and is also quite strong on compile time verification to make this more type safe.\nHowever: I just want to run the script at startup.  It's simple &amp; I can do it from standard postgres cli, so I should be able to it simply from rust as well.  The sqlx::query method will convert the SQL to a prepared statement, which does not play nice with such a query:\nsqlx::query(include_str!(\"setup.sql\")).execute(&amp;pool).await?;\n\nHere's the error you may get:\ncannot insert multiple commands into a prepared statement\n\nInstead, you can use the Executor trait which is implemented for &amp;PgPool.  This does make it a little awkward to write having to have the extra brackets:\n(&amp;pool).execute(include_str!(\"setup.sql\")).await?;\n\nMapping a postgresql query to rust structs\nsqlx has a query_as method which allows you to convert returned result rows into rust structs, a bit like serde is used to serialize/deserialize data.\nThis works by deriving sqlx::FromRow on your structs:\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug, Clone, sqlx::FromRow)]\npub struct Job {\n    pub id: i64,\n    pub username: String,\n    pub name: String,\n    pub uuid: Uuid,\n    pub params: Value,\n    pub priority: Priority,\n    pub status: Status,\n}\n\nAs I am using custom enums, I also need to derive sqlx::Type on them:\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug, Clone, sqlx::Type)]\npub enum Status {\n    Queued,\n    Processing,\n    Completed,\n    Failed,\n}\n\n(Side note: custom enums may not be a hot idea for maintainability)\nWith that I can do away with the old get_jobs method, as this is handled for me now by SQLx.\nI can then use the fetch_all method to return is as a Vec:\npub(crate) async fn get_processing_jobs(&amp;self) -&gt; Result&lt;Vec&lt;Job&gt;, Error&gt; {\n    let query = \"select id, name, username, uuid, params, priority, status from jobq\n                 where status = 'Processing' order by priority asc, time asc\";\n\n    Ok(sqlx::query_as(query).fetch_all(&amp;*self.pool).await?)\n}\n\nWorthy of note: the fetch method returns a futures Stream to iterate through, making a much tighter integration with async\nBinding Parameters\nI didn't need to change SQL statements at all, but did need to adjust some of the binding parameters using the bind builder pattern:\npub(crate) async fn complete_job(&amp;self, id: i64) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt; {\n    let query = \"update jobq set status = 'Completed', duration = extract(epoch from now() - \\\"time\\\") where id = $1\";\n\n    sqlx::query(query).bind(&amp;id).execute(&amp;*self.pool).await?;\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n\nThis is different to tokio-postgres accepting an array of parameters.  I have ran into issues before when trying to pass dynamic arguments and trying to wrangle life times.  Here is how I have worked around this in the past (not exactly pretty):\nfor row in self.pool.get()?.query(\n    &amp;*query,\n    params\n        .iter()\n        .map(|val| &amp;**val as &amp;(dyn ToSql + Sync))\n        .collect::&lt;Vec&lt;_&gt;&gt;()\n        .as_slice(),\n)?\n\nConclusions\nAs you can see from the diff of the commits, the conversion to use SQLx was an easy excercise.  I have found SQLx quite a bit more lightweight and more to my liking than some of the heavier ORMs I've dealt with in the past.  Being async first means that this will be a great fit for the ecosystem: I can see it becoming the defacto async story for databases in the future.\nOne area which may need some improvement is the documentation &amp; examples.  As it is a comparitively young library with the first commit a year ago, I assume that this will only get better with time.  The README  and api docs were enough for me to get into trouble.\nIf you are looking to talk to a database with async rust, make sure you consider SQLx!\n","id":"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/implementing-a-jobq-sqlx/","title":"Implementing a Job queue with SQLx and Postgres"},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/implementing-a-jobq-with-tokio/":{"body":"In the last blog of this series, I implemented job queue with tmq.  I noted back then that tmq is great if you need to interact with other languages, but may be a little overkill if you are just using rust.  I wondered what it'd take to build the job queue with a smaller library footprint, using something like tokio-serde instead of tmq.  It was successful, and this blog will step through some of the changes needed.\nTo follow along, these changes are on the tokio_serde branch of the jobq repo.\nIf you are getting lost make sure you review the last blog to see some of the logic &amp; design tradeoffs.\nWhat is Tokio-Serde\nTokio-Serde is a little glue library that allows you to serialise/deserialise objects on the wire. With the help of tokio-util's codec feature, you can use Tokio-Serde to encode/decode bytes into discrete messages to be passed on the wire.\nFrom the Tokio-Serde documentation using tokio-serde is 3 layers deep:\n\ntokio::net::TcpStream: The raw Stream/Sink where we can get/send bytes\ntokio_util::codec::Framed: The ability to chunk bytes into discrete frames\ntokio_serde::Framed: The ability to take these frames &amp; then serialize/deserialize them\n\nThe TCP Stream\nThe TCP stream is your standard tcp connection.  In tokio, you can either bind or connect to a TCP socket.\nWith connect, you will get a straight tcp stream, if successful:\nlet tcp_stream = TcpStream::connect(\"127.0.0.1:17653\").await?;\n\nWith bind you will get a listener, which will produce tcp streams when new connections come in:\nlet mut listener = TcpListener::bind(\"127.0.0.1:17653\").await?;\n\nwhile let Some(tcp_stream) = listener.try_next().await? {\n    //do something with the tcp stream\n}\n\nThe Frame\nOk so we have bytes coming across the wire now from our standard TCP stream.  As bytes come in, the tcp stream will be woken up so work can commence on it.  But TCP streams do not have a beginning or end, they are just a stream of bytes. We need something to break up this stream of bytes into discrete objects.  This is where tokio_util::codec::Framed comes in: it chunks down bytes on the wire into frames.\nThe tokio_util crate comes with the Encoder/Decoder traits which allow you to implement this.  tokio-util also comes with a simple, Length Delimited Codec which, on the wire looks like this:\n+----------+--------------------------------+\n| length   |          payload               |\n+----------+--------------------------------+\n\nWhen decoding, this will read the length header, allocate some memory and wait until the payload is fully delivered.  If there are not enough bytes on the wire to do this, then it will be continuously polled until it is ready, keeping around a buffer. The semantics of Decoder mean that if you return no bytes, then it's an indication there needs to be more to decode a frame successfully.\nWhen encoding, the whole thing is ready to go, so tack on the length, your payload and let tokio handle the rest.\nThe Serde Frame\nWe now have some raw bytes that have been bundled into frames which can be encoded/decoded from the raw bytes into something more meaningful.  Rather than implement this by hand, we can rely on tokio-serde with one of the existing codecs, such as JSON, CBOR, Bincode or Messagepack.\nOur existing job queue uses CBOR so we'll use that here as well.  We can use the same messages we have previously used but we will condense down the Client/Worker to just ClientMessage:\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]\npub enum ServerMessage {\n    Hello(String), // Hello with client name\n    Request(JobRequest),\n    Completed(Job),\n    Failed(Job, String),\n}\n\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]\npub enum ClientMessage {\n    Hello(String),\n    Order(Job),\n    Acknowledged(Job),\n}\n\nPutting these 3 layers together, we get a Stream/Sink we can send values to:\nlet tcp_stream = TcpStream::connect(addr).await?;\n\nlet length_delimited = tokio_util::codec::Framed::new(tcp_stream, LengthDelimitedCodec::new());\n\nlet connection = tokio_serde::Framed::new(length_delimited, Cbor::default());\n\nWith that we have our transport that we want: length delimited cbor frames.  On the wire this is not too different to ZeroMQ, but would probably shave a few bytes here and there.  Now we need to implement the Server/Client components.\nImplementing a Server\nWe want to accept connections from clients/workers and then route out messages to the appropriate connection.  We will leave the server logic itself mostly untouched, and instead replace the tmq::router with a new Router  struct which uses tokio-serde\nThe Router\nThe Router struct handles incoming client connections and allows our server logic to send messages based upon their name.\nWe have multiple clients/workers that will be connecting to our jobq server so we will need to keep around some state to handle those connections.  How will we do that? Well, a simple HashMap&lt;String, Connection&gt; is probably a good start.  When a connection comes in, we want to add it to our map of known clients.\nIf a connection drops off (i.e, returns Poll::Ready(None) from the Stream) then we can clean it from our known connections. If a new client with the same name comes in, we can just drop off the old client connection (alternatively, we could reject the new one).  These semantics are obviously different from the ZeroMQ Router socket, and not nearly as robust, but are good enough for a PoC.\nThe router can be implemented as a Stream which, when polled will check:\n\nAny pending tcp connections\nAny pending clients that are in the middle of handshaking\nAny pending messages from existing clients\n\nThis can be seen as a loop, whereby each time we hit poll_next we will hit all 3 areas in case we have anything waiting for us.  If there is nothing in one area, then we move onto the next one, and so on.  We can do an if let Poll::Ready() pattern here to skip things that aren't ready.\nPending Clients\nHow do we know the client name when connecting?  Well we can implement a list of pending clients.  When they send a ServerMessage::Hello  message, we can then put them in our known clients list.  This is a pretty lightweight handshake, but accomplishes our goals.\nFirst, we convert the tcp stream from listener into a list of pending clients:\nlet self_mut = &amp;mut self.as_mut();\n\nif let Poll::Ready(val) = Pin::new(&amp;mut self_mut.listener).poll_next(cx) {\n    match val {\n        Some(Ok(tcp_stream)) =&gt; {\n            let length_delimited =\n                CodecFramed::new(tcp_stream, LengthDelimitedCodec::new());\n\n            let framed = Framed::new(length_delimited, Cbor::default());\n\n            self_mut.pending_clients.push(framed);\n        }\n        Some(Err(err)) =&gt; {\n            error!(\"Error checking for new requests:{:?}\", err);\n        }\n        None =&gt; {\n            return Poll::Ready(None);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nNow, with that checked off, we can then consult our pending clients.  Note here I am swapping out the pending clients Vec with an empty Vec to avoid doubly borrowing as mutable.  There may be an easier/more efficient way of doing this and would be interested in knowing what that may look like.\nWe will repopulate the list as we go through, so we won't lose any pending clients, but one or two may drop off if they are not doing the handshake correctly or they have already disconnected.  We'll also add the Hello message to our messages to send as a Stream response.  That's our buffer that we will be using.\nlet mut new_pending = Vec::new();\nmem::swap(&amp;mut self_mut.pending_clients, &amp;mut new_pending);\n\nfor mut pending in new_pending.into_iter() {\n    if let Poll::Ready(val) = Pin::new(&amp;mut pending).poll_next(cx) {\n        match val {\n            Some(Ok(ServerMessage::Hello(name))) =&gt; {\n                debug!(\"New Client connection from `{}`\", name);\n                self_mut.buffer.push(ServerMessage::Hello(name.clone()));\n                self_mut.clients.insert(name, pending);\n            }\n            Some(Ok(msg)) =&gt; {\n                warn!(\"Received unknown message during handshake:{:?}\", msg);\n            }\n            Some(Err(err)) =&gt; {\n                error!(\"Error checking for new requests:{:?}\", err);\n            }\n            None =&gt; (),\n        }\n    } else {\n        self_mut.pending_clients.push(pending);\n    }\n}\n\nExisting Clients\nWe'll do the same trick for the client HashMap: swap it out for an empty one as we're processing.\nWe'll put all received messages into an internal buffer, which we will use later to send the actual response from the stream.\nlet mut new_clients = HashMap::new();\nmem::swap(&amp;mut self_mut.clients, &amp;mut new_clients);\n\nfor (name, mut client) in new_clients.into_iter() {\n    match Pin::new(&amp;mut client).poll_next(cx) {\n        Poll::Ready(Some(Ok(val))) =&gt; {\n            trace!(\"Received message from `{}`: {:?}\", name, val);\n            self_mut.buffer.push(val);\n            self_mut.clients.insert(name, client);\n        }\n        Poll::Ready(None) =&gt; {\n            //Finished\n            debug!(\"Client `{}` disconnecting\", name);\n        }\n        Poll::Ready(Some(Err(err))) =&gt; {\n            //Error\n            error!(\"Error from `{}`: {} Removing connection.\", name, err);\n        }\n        Poll::Pending =&gt; {\n            self_mut.clients.insert(name, client);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nReturning Messages\nWe've buffered up the returned messages into a Vec and we can return one.  But if there are more after popping we can let the waker know we may have more stuff to process:\nif let Some(val) = self_mut.buffer.pop() {\n    if self_mut.buffer.len() &gt; 0 {\n        cx.waker().wake_by_ref();\n    }\n    return Poll::Ready(Some(Ok(val)));\n}\n\nreturn Poll::Pending;\n\nSending Messages\nSending messages requires that you know the name of the client, but it is otherwise a simple wrapper:\npub async fn send_message(&amp;mut self, client: &amp;str, msg: ClientMessage) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt; {\n    if let Some(connection) = self.clients.get_mut(client) {\n        connection.send(msg).await?;\n    } else {\n        return Err(anyhow!(\"Client `{}` not connected!\", client));\n    }\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n\nWe can even expose a way to check if any clients are connected of that name, and simply not bother sending a message in this case:\npub fn is_connected(&amp;self, client: &amp;str) -&gt; bool {\n    self.clients.contains_key(client)\n}\n\nChanges to the Server\nThe Server struct itself does not really change all that much.  Instead of using a tmq::router we'll use our new Router.  Although strictly not equivalent, for the purpose of the job queue, this is an OK analogue:\nlet mut router = Router::new(&amp;self.job_address).await?;\n\nwhile let Some(server_msg) = router.next().await {\n    // existing server logic here\n}\n\nImplementing Clients\nNot much has changed here as well.  We could get away with not using our own struct definition here at all and just set up a connection, but would be great if we had something we could plop in where the old tmq::dealer was used.\nDealer\nWe implement a Dealer struct which simply wraps a tokio_serde::Framed:\ntype ClientFramed = Framed&lt;\n    CodecFramed&lt;TcpStream, LengthDelimitedCodec&gt;,\n    ClientMessage,\n    ServerMessage,\n    Cbor&lt;ClientMessage, ServerMessage&gt;,\n&gt;;\n\npub struct Dealer {\n    connection: ClientFramed,\n}\n\nimpl Dealer {\n    pub async fn new&lt;A: ToSocketAddrs&gt;(addr: A) -&gt; Result&lt;Self, Error&gt; {\n        let tcp_stream = TcpStream::connect(addr).await?;\n\n        let length_delimited = CodecFramed::new(tcp_stream, LengthDelimitedCodec::new());\n\n        let connection = Framed::new(length_delimited, Cbor::default());\n\n        Ok(Self { connection })\n    }\n}\n\nWith the dealer, both receiving and sending marry up with Stream and Sink quite well, so we can implement that quite easily:\nimpl Stream for Dealer {\n    type Item = Result&lt;ClientMessage, Error&gt;;\n\n    fn poll_next(mut self: Pin&lt;&amp;mut Self&gt;, cx: &amp;mut Context&lt;'_&gt;) -&gt; Poll&lt;Option&lt;Self::Item&gt;&gt; {\n        let self_mut = &amp;mut self.as_mut();\n\n        match Pin::new(&amp;mut self_mut.connection).poll_next(cx) {\n            Poll::Ready(Some(val)) =&gt; Poll::Ready(Some(val.map_err(|err| err.into()))),\n            Poll::Ready(None) =&gt; Poll::Ready(None),\n            Poll::Pending =&gt; Poll::Pending,\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWorker Changes\nThe worker doesn't change much, we call split on the Dealer struct to get our two pipes, but otherwise treat it as per normal:\nlet (mut send_skt, recv) = Dealer::new(&amp;job_address).await?.split();\n\nRunning the Changes\nRunning the branch we should see a lot of the same chatter we saw from the previous version:\n 2020-05-13 11:13:02 DEBUG jobq::server &gt; New: Job { id: 5500, username: \"test_client\", name: \"test\", uuid: 95182793-7a08-4329-a9f1-4be0c1f1d041, params: Null, priority: Normal, status: Queued }\n 2020-05-13 11:13:02 WARN  jobq::server &gt; Job failed: 5496, Reason: Simulating failure\n 2020-05-13 11:13:02 WARN  jobq::server &gt; Job failed: 5484, Reason: Simulating failure\n 2020-05-13 11:13:02 WARN  jobq::server &gt; Job failed: 5472, Reason: Simulating failure\n 2020-05-13 11:13:03 WARN  jobq::server &gt; Job failed: 5460, Reason: Simulating failure\n\nConclusion\nImplementing a more barebones messaging system native in rust took not much time at all.  While this solution is not nearly as robust as using ZeroMQ, it does provide a more building blocks approach to messaging, reducing external dependencies.  I found the hardest portion was gluing everything together between the 3 main crates and getting the types right.  Tokio-Serde could use a bit more fleshing out and does seem quite embryonic still, but it is enough to get your hands dirty.\nThe initial design of the jobq made it easy to slot in another transport layer as well.  All the structs &amp; types were all ready and rolling to go, we just needed a couple of extra libraries to fill in the pieces.\n","id":"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/implementing-a-jobq-with-tokio/","title":"Implementing a Job queue with Tokio-Serde"},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/implementing-a-jobq/":{"body":"One of the challenges I have had with on premise solutions is the lack of reliable environments and constrained resources.   Not only are you limited in your ability to control things, you need to ensure that things continue on in the case of failure.\nI was tasked with rewriting the job processing pipeline for my company's product, SchoolBench, to ensure a greater level of robustness in the case of service or system failure.\nThis article steps through an approach to this using async rust &amp; the help of tokio ZeroMQ library: tmq along with tokio-postgres.\nAs some excellent work has been put in bringing tmq to async, I thought it pertinent to look at reapproaching the pipeline using async code.  I have published an initial prototype of what the end result may look like, and will be stepping through the approach here, and some of the tradeoffs I made\nWhy TMQ/ZeroMQ?\nFor those not familiar with ZeroMQ, it is a messaging library with a lot of features, from standard publish/subscribe to more elaborate arrangements.  tmq is a tokio compatible binding that allows you to bridge ZeroMQ with the async world of rust.\nYou would use ZeroMQ if you need to interact with other languages easily and don't want it to be too opinionated on what message formats are being sent.  If you are purely using rust then this may be not be a great fit, but it does still provide you some great interprocess &amp; internetwork capabilities that you won't get from just tokio.\nWe use ZeroMQ in SchoolBench as it is a polyglot application and has a lot of components written in python &amp; java as well as rust.  It is lightweight enough not to cause overheads &amp; complex enough for the use cases I have thrown at it so far.\nPrior Work\nThere are some existing rust based job queues that do similar things and may be more suited to your own personal tastes:\n\nhttps://github.com/kureuil/batch-rs\nhttps://github.com/badboy/oppgave\nhttps://github.com/rusty-celery/rusty-celery\nProbably lots more I haven't found\n\nMost of them use some sort of message broker, such as RabbitMQ or Redis.\nWhat is a Job?\nIt helps to explain what a job is.  In the context of SchoolBench a job is a piece of work that may take some time to do (think seconds), is quite intensive, and may fail. Once an asset is saved into SchoolBench, lots of processes are kicked off in the background to fill in the blanks and provide information about the asset.\nSome examples of jobs are:\n\nRunning Facial Recognition on images using tensorflow\nGenerating Thumbnails and Watermarked renditions of images\nCalculating whether a photo is a duplicate of another photo and marking the set of duplicates\n\nA lot of these are quite intensive &amp; can sometimes fail in weird and wonderful ways:  An image uploaded may be corrupted, so renditions may not run;  There may be an issue running the neural net;  The VM may be experience ballooning and fail to allocate memory, etc...\nSo we need a way of describing a discrete piece of work which may happen some time in the future and may happen by a completely isolated process.\nResource Contention\nWe have very limited resources in an on premise environment. After providing a minimum recommendation it is important to tune for that worst case.  This is different in a cloud environment where you can spin up guests in a work stealing fashion if you throw more money at your infrastructure. on premise is usually more fixed in terms of server and hardware allocations, and so we need to plan for that.\nThis is one area where the job queue deviates from a lot of existing systems out there: we assume we're just running on the one set of CPUs and so there is a fixed number of active jobs at any given time.\nWe also want a simple way to prioritise tasks as they are submitted, so that some jobs finish first, with higher value jobs such as thumbnail generation happening first. The job queue uses a simple 3-tier priority system to do this: High, Medium &amp; Low.\nThis simple system could mean if there are not enough resources to finish jobs then there is a chance that lower tier jobs may never get around to completing.  In practice the sort of work loads we have seen this is not the case, but it is a possibility. In which case more processors would be needed to keep up with the load or another style of priority to be implemented (such as fair queueing).\nPersistence\nJobs need to survive crashes and server restarts in a robust fashion.  Existing job queues utilise an existing persistence layer/message broker such as Redis or RabbitMQ.  I have chosen PostgreSQL as the persistence layer as it is performant enough, and is already in use for metadata storage.  However, you could easily swap out another type of persistence with a bit of refactoring.\nThe Overall Process\nThe high level proces is as follows:\n\nA User Action triggers some sort of logic which requests a job.  This could be an automatic rule somewhere or could be the a user specifically requesting a job to run\nA server listens for requests and puts them into a queue\nIf there are jobs that can be processed then they are submitted to the individual worker who is responsible for finishing the job\nWhen a job completes or fails, then it is marked as so with a duration on how long things take\nEverytime a new event is triggered, such as a job in a queue or a job completed/failed, the server checks to see if it can mark jobs as processing\nAll job status updates &amp; information is persisted to a db, so that things can pick up again if there is a failure &amp; reports can be ran using standard SQL tools\n\nClient, Server, Worker\nWe split the roles of the job queue into 3 different types:\n\nClients that submit requests to the server\nThe Server which does the main job queue loop\nThe Workers that receive jobs and do work, returning whether the work was completed (not the work outcome itself, just the status; we assume that the worker will update something out of band like another db or filesystem)\n\nOne possible thing to note is that there is only ever one server, but there can be as many workers and clients as allowed.  The workers themselves can also be clients and submit requests if they want to.\nCommunication\nThe server, worker and clients all communicate via a ZeroMQ DEALER/ROUTER socket.\nClients and Workers use the DEALER style socket to retrieve &amp; send messages, but also identify themselves, and the server uses ROUTER. The identity is included as the first ZeroMQ multipart frame when it is received and so can be used to route messages back to the appropriate place.\nThe messages are serialised on the wire as CBOR using serde_cbor.  CBOR was chosen because it allows for the message type to be flexible &amp; there are plenty of implementations in other languages.  JSON could be used as well, as arguably the support for JSON is much higher, but would mean larger message sizes. \nWith serde it's pretty easy to adjust what serialisation is used, so some experimentation could be worthwhile.\nThe Job Structs\nThe Job struct is defined as follows (with the Status &amp; Priority enums listed too):\npub struct Job {\n    pub id: i64, // ID of the Job so it can be tracked\n    pub username: String, // Username of who submitted the job\n    pub name: String, // Name of the job/worker, `rendition`, etc..\n    pub uuid: Uuid, // Unique ID of the asset\n    pub params: Value,// Any parameters of the job in question\n    pub priority: Priority, // The priority of the job\n    pub status: Status,// The status of the job\n}\n\nThe job has a current status which starts with Queued, goes to Processing when it is active and then marked as either Completed or Failed:\npub enum Status {\n    Queued,\n    Processing,\n    Completed,\n    Failed,\n}\n\nThe priority is a simple 3-tier system of High, Normal &amp; Low:\npub enum Priority {\n    High,\n    Normal,\n    Low,\n}\n\nMessage types\nMessages are split up based upon who the destination is with a shared Hello message that can be serialised as any enum:\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]\npub enum ServerMessage {\n    Hello,\n    Request(JobRequest),\n    Completed(Job),\n    Failed(Job, String),\n}\n\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]\npub enum ClientMessage {\n    Hello,\n    Acknowledged(Job),\n}\n\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]\npub enum WorkerMessage {\n    Hello,\n    Order(Job),\n}\n\nThe  JobRequest is very similar to a Job but does not have an allocated id or status yet:\npub struct JobRequest {\n    pub name: String,\n    pub username: String,\n    pub uuid: Uuid,\n    pub params: Value,\n    pub priority: Priority,\n}\n\nThe Params Value\nOne thing to note is the params is of the type serde_json::Value.  This is really to allow the greatest flexibility into what parameters are sent with each job &amp; also to have it persist to PostgreSQL as a jsonb column.\nAlternatively, a tighter enum could be used for different job names if you knew ahead of time the jobs that will be requested.\nSerialisation helpers\nTo reduce some of the repetitiveness, there is a serialisation helper which simply serialises to CBOR for any struct that implements Serialize:\npub trait ToMpart {\n    fn to_mpart(&amp;self) -&gt; Result&lt;Multipart, Error&gt;;\n\n    fn to_msg(&amp;self) -&gt; Result&lt;Message, Error&gt;;\n}\n\nimpl&lt;T: serde::ser::Serialize&gt; ToMpart for T {\n    fn to_mpart(&amp;self) -&gt; Result&lt;Multipart, Error&gt; {\n        let bytes = serde_cbor::to_vec(&amp;self)?;\n\n        Ok(Multipart::from(vec![&amp;bytes]))\n    }\n\n    fn to_msg(&amp;self) -&gt; Result&lt;Message, Error&gt; {\n        let bytes = serde_cbor::to_vec(&amp;self)?;\n\n        Ok(Message::from(&amp;bytes))\n    }\n}\n\nClient Requests\nClients can send requests by constructing job requests and sending them to the server.  They just need to construct the Request enum and send it on the wire:\nlet (mut send, mut recv) = dealer(&amp;Context::new())\n    .set_identity(b\"test_client\")\n    .connect(&amp;config.job_address)?\n    .split::&lt;Multipart&gt;();\n\nlet job = JobRequest {\n    name: \"test\".into(),\n    username: \"test_client\".into(),\n    params: Value::Null,\n    uuid: Uuid::new_v4(),\n    priority: PriorityLow,\n};\n\nsend.send(ServerMessage::Request(job).to_mpart()?).await?;\n\nWorker Processing\nFor workers doing the work, they should do something &amp; then return whether it's failed or completed.\nTo make this easier, a Worker trait is implemented.  Since some work will be async &amp; some not, we want our trait to be async-capable.  At the writing of this article you can't have async in trait definitions, but there is the async_trait crate that allows you to decorate a trait definition and do what we're after.\nFor errors we're going to use the anyhow crate, but a more generic error approach could be used with a bit of a refactor.\n#[async_trait]\npub trait Worker: Sized {\n    const JOB_NAME: &amp;'static str;\n\n    async fn process(&amp;self, job: Job) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt;\n}\n\nThe implementation of this trait means that you can do lots within the process body and simplifies it.\nAn original version had the process method accept &amp;mut self, but that caused some contention when trying to process jobs concurrently.  Instead you'll need some interior mutability if you need to provide any mutable references to &amp;self.\nAs an example, the test worker will simply wait for 100 milliseconds and then fail every 12th job based upon the id:\nimpl Worker for TestWorker {\n    const JOB_NAME: &amp;'static str = \"test\";\n\n    async fn process(&amp;self, job: Job) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt; {\n        delay_for(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;\n        if job.id % 12 == 0 {\n            return Err(anyhow!(\"Simulating failure\"));\n        }\n\n        Ok(())\n    }\n}\n\nThe Work Method\nThere is another method, work, on the trait which sets up &amp; hides some of the complexity away of getting a worker to listen for requests coming through.   This is plumbing to make it easy to run a Worker.\nasync fn work(&amp;self, job_address: &amp;str) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt; {\n    ...\n} \n\nYou can await this method for anything that implements Worker to have it process incoming requests:\nuse jobq::worker::{Worker, TestWorker};\n\ntokio::spawn(async move {\n    if let Err(err) = TestWorker.work(&amp;worker_config.job_address).await {\n        error!(\"{}\", err);\n    }\n});\n\nUnder the hood it uses the job address to communicate with a Server and glues up some requests\nFirstly, it creates a dealer socket, setting the identity accordingly:\nlet (mut send_skt, recv) = dealer(&amp;Context::new())\n    .set_identity(job_name.as_bytes())\n    .connect(&amp;job_address)?\n    .split::&lt;Multipart&gt;();\n\nAs ZeroMQ sockets are Send but not Sync, we spin up a background task connected by an unbounded queue which allows the sender to be cloned.  This allows both heartbeats to be sent every 10 seconds from a background task &amp; also send results of processing:\nlet (send, mut recv_skt) = unbounded::&lt;ServerMessage&gt;();\n\ntokio::spawn(async move {\n    while let Some(jobq_message) = recv_skt.next().await {\n        if let Ok(msg) = jobq_message.to_mpart() {\n            if let Err(err) = send_skt.send(msg).await {\n                error!(\"Error sending message:{}\", err);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n});\n\nThe 10 second heartbeat is similiarly set up as a separate task:\ntokio::spawn(async move {\n    loop {\n        if let Err(err) = ping_sender.send(ServerMessage::Hello).await {\n            error!(\"Error:{}\", err);\n        };\n        delay_for(Duration::from_millis(10000)).await;\n    }\n});\n\nThere is then a big combinator statement which in effect listens for job requests &amp; then runs them in parallel:\nrecv.filter_map(|val| {\n    match val\n        .map_err(Error::from)\n        .and_then(|msg| serde_cbor::from_slice(&amp;msg[0]).map_err(Error::from))\n    {\n        Ok(WorkerMessage::Order(job)) =&gt; return ready(Some(job)),\n        Ok(WorkerMessage::Hello) =&gt; {\n            debug!(\"Pong: {}\", job_type);\n        }\n        Err(err) =&gt; {\n            error!(\"Error decoding message:{}\", err);\n        }\n    }\n\n    return ready(None);\n})\n.map(|job| (self.process(job.clone()), send.clone(), job))\n.for_each_concurrent(None, |(status, mut send, job)| async move {\n    let server_message = match status.await {\n        Ok(()) =&gt; ServerMessage::Completed(job),\n        Err(err) =&gt; ServerMessage::Failed(job, err.to_string()),\n    };\n\n    if let Err(err) = send.send(server_message).await {\n        error!(\"Error sending server message: {}\", err);\n    }\n})\n.await;\n\nThere is a bit of cloning here that could probably be avoided, but the overhead of cloning a job is not that big.\nThe for_each_concurrent allows the worker to run concurrently, and is one of the reasons the trait takes &amp;self rather than &amp;mut self.\nAll of this is essentially generic on the Worker trait, meaning this plumbing is handled for you when you call work(&amp;address).\nBlocking Tasks\nSome tasks may be blocking, which is a no-no in the async world.  If one of the async worker threads is blocked then it can't listen for more events &amp; will slow things down.  Luckily tokio does provide the spawn_blocking helper for executing blocking work on a dedicated threadpool:\nlet result =\n   tokio::task::spawn_blocking(move || do_blocking_work(job));\n\nresult.await??;\n\nThe double .await?? is because the JoinHandle returned from spawn_blocking itself could fail and the internal result from the closure could fail.\nTo control how many threads are used for blocking operations, you need to manually build your tokio run time, rather than use the tokio::main macro.\nThe the number of blocking threads is max_threads - core_threads.  For instance, if you wanted only 2 dedicated blocking threads:\nlet mut rt = tokio::runtime::Builder::new()\n    .threaded_scheduler()\n    .enable_all()\n    .core_threads(4)\n    .max_threads(6)\n    .build()?\n\nThe Server Loop\nThe server loop is the main loop responsible for coordinating tasks &amp; otherwise tasks are finished in the order they are supposed to.  The server here responds to messages from the ZeroMQ socket &amp; acts according to the message received.\nSetup Phase\nThe setup phase involves setting up a db handle, then querying the database for any outstanding processing jobs.  This is to ensure that they don't become stuck as part of a server restart, but can mean that there may be duplicate jobs submitted.  If your jobs provide the same outcome based upon the job at hand this isn't a big deal, so the workers should do work that is idempotent if at all possible.\nOnce that is done, the server keeps an active count of jobs &amp; increments/decrements them when jobs finish/fail or start.\nMain Loop\nThe main loop simply waits until a message is received, and acts accordingly:\nwhile let Some(msg) = recv.try_next().await? {\n\n    // This is the `ROUTER` socket identity\n    let client_name = &amp;msg[0];\n    // This is the message\n    let server_msg = serde_cbor::from_slice::&lt;ServerMessage&gt;(&amp;msg[1]);\n    \n    match server_msg {\n        ...\n    }\n\n}\n\nHello Message\nIf a Hello message is received then the server will send any outstanding processing jobs it knows about:\n//Drain out existing processing jobs\nlet (jobs, outstanding): (Vec&lt;Job&gt;, Vec&lt;Job&gt;) =\n    processing.into_iter().partition(|job| job.name == name);\n\nprocessing = outstanding;\n\nfor job in jobs {\n    send_job(&amp;handle, job, &amp;mut send).await?;\n}\n\nThe processing vec is only ever populated at server start, and so should mostly be empty unless the server was restarted with jobs that were active.\nAfter checking all this it responds back with a Hello\nJob Request\nIf a Request message comes in, the server adds this to the db &amp; then sends an Acknowledged message back to the client with the populated details.  This doesn't yet start the job however, merely it sets the job in a Queued state.\nCompleted\nIf a Completed message comes in then the server marks it as completed decrementing the active job count.\nFailed\nIf a Failed message comes in the server will mark the job as failed and submit the reason with it, decrementing the active job count\nError Deserialising\nThere is a possibility that a connected client could send an invalid message, so we just log with a warn level in this case, skipping the message:\nmatch server_msg {\n    ....\n    Err(err) =&gt; {\n        warn!(\"Could not deserialize message:{}\", err);\n    }\n}\n\nSubmit Tasks\nAfter the main loop matching against the message types, the server checks to see if there are any active slots &amp; if so, queries the database for any queued jobs:\n// If we have less active tasks lets check the queued stuff\nif active &lt; self.num {\n    let jobs = handle\n        .get_queued_jobs(self.num as i64 - active as i64)\n        .await?;\n\n    for job in jobs {\n        send_job(&amp;handle, job, &amp;mut send).await?;\n        active = active + 1;\n    }\n}\n\nAfter this processing, the server then waits again for the next message.\nDatabase Persistence\nOne of the requirements is ensuring that jobs stay around and are persisted somewhere.   The prototype uses PostgreSQL to do this.\nAs this is async, we'll use tokio-postgres to perform updates.  tokio postgres has some nice docs to get us started, so we will use their example to build a database handler:\nuse tokio_postgres::{NoTls, Error};\n\n#[tokio::main] // By default, tokio_postgres uses the tokio crate as its runtime.\nasync fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt; {\n    // Connect to the database.\n    let (client, connection) =\n        tokio_postgres::connect(\"host=localhost user=postgres\", NoTls).await?;\n\n    // The connection object performs the actual communication with the database,\n    // so spawn it off to run on its own.\n    tokio::spawn(async move {\n        if let Err(e) = connection.await {\n            eprintln!(\"connection error: {}\", e);\n        }\n    });\n\n    // Now we can execute a simple statement that just returns its parameter.\n    let rows = client\n        .query(\"SELECT $1::TEXT\", &amp;[&amp;\"hello world\"])\n        .await?;\n\n    // And then check that we got back the same string we sent over.\n    let value: &amp;str = rows[0].get(0);\n    assert_eq!(value, \"hello world\");\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n\nEnums and Postgres Types\nYou can use the postgres_types crate to save simple enums to a table.\nSo the Priority struct can be persisted to the db like so:\nCREATE TYPE \"Priority\" as enum ('High', 'Normal', 'Low');\n\nA Simple Migration\nHopefully our schema never changes.. Right?\nWell, in the prototype it won't. So we can simply embed an SQL script to run when the a db handler starts up:\npub struct DbHandle {\n    client: Arc&lt;Client&gt;,\n}\n\nimpl DbHandle {\n    pub(crate) async fn new(url: &amp;str) -&gt; Result&lt;Self, Error&gt; {\n        let (client, connection) = tokio_postgres::connect(&amp;url, NoTls).await?;\n\n        tokio::spawn(async move {\n            if let Err(e) = connection.await {\n                error!(\"connection error: {}\", e);\n            }\n        });\n\n        client.batch_execute(include_str!(\"setup.sql\")).await?;\n\n        Ok(DbHandle {\n            client: Arc::new(client),\n        })\n    }\n    ...\n}\n\nThis setup.sql script should be designed to run more than once, but skip the parts that it's already done.  There are a couple tricks to do this, but obviously doesn't work if you are adding/removing columns from a table etc..\nFor the enum types, you can just check the pg_type to make sure that they exist &amp; if not add them:\nIF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_type WHERE typname = 'Status') THEN\n    CREATE TYPE \"Status\" as enum ('Queued', 'Processing', 'Completed', 'Failed');\nEND IF\n\nWith the table &amp; indexes you can do a CREATE &lt;blah&gt; IF NOT EXISTS:\nCREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS status_idx ON jobq (\n    status\n);\n\nThis won't error out if the index/table already exists, meaning you're safe to run the setup.sql multiple times!\nGetting jobs from the DB\nQuerying for jobs is quite simple, you just select the columns you want and do a get() or try_get() on them:\nimpl DbHandle {\n    ....\n    pub(crate) async fn get_queued_jobs(&amp;self, num: i64) -&gt; Result&lt;Vec&lt;Job&gt;, Error&gt; {\n        let query = \"select \n                        id,\n                        name,\n                        username,\n                        uuid,\n                        params,\n                        priority,\n                        status\n                     from jobq\n                     where \n                        status = 'Queued'\n                     order by\n                     priority asc, time asc\n                     limit $1\";\n\n        let mut jobs = Vec::new();\n\n        for row in result {\n            let id = row.try_get(0)?;\n            let name = row.try_get(1)?;\n            let username = row.try_get(2)?;\n            let uuid = row.try_get(3)?;\n            let params = row.try_get(4)?;\n            let priority = row.try_get(5)?;\n            let status = row.try_get(6)?;\n\n            jobs.push({\n                Job {\n                    id,\n                    username,\n                    name,\n                    uuid,\n                    params,\n                    priority,\n                    status,\n                }\n            });\n        }\n\n        Ok(jobs)\n    }\n    ...\n\nThere are a number of other methods as complete_job, fail_job that handle the SQL stuff &amp; make it simple for the Server to use.\nKeeping things persisted in the database means we can use standard SQL tools to introspect the job queue and see where it's at.\nRecording the job duration\nThe duration of the job is recorded when the job is finished/failed:\npub(crate) async fn complete_job(&amp;self, id: i64) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt; {\n    let query = \"update jobq set status = 'Completed', duration = extract(epoch from now() - \\\"time\\\") where id = $1\";\n\n    self.client.query(query, &amp;[&amp;id]).await?;\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n\nThis could've been done inside rust as well using Instant but would require a bit more state to be handled in the Server.  I've elected here to use a PostgreSQL solution instead to lean on the db.\nRunning the example\nThe example starts the test worker, a server and a client to submit 500 simple jobs:\nfor i in 0..500 {\n    let priority = if i % 2 == 0 {\n        Priority::High\n    } else {\n        Priority::Normal\n    };\n\n    let job = JobRequest {\n        name: \"test\".into(),\n        username: \"test_client\".into(),\n        params: Value::Null,\n        uuid: Uuid::new_v4(),\n        priority,\n    };\n\n    send.send(ServerMessage::Request(job).to_mpart()?).await?;\n}\n\nRunning with cargo run you will see the output after some time, with the simulated failures:\n2020-04-14 16:04:33 DEBUG jobq         &gt; Message:Acknowledged(Job { id: 2999, username: \"test_client\", name: \"test\", uuid: fe6e21fc-8064-4c9a-965d-b1d124f2416d, params: Null, priority: High, status: Queued })\n2020-04-14 16:04:33 DEBUG jobq::server &gt; New: Job { id: 3000, username: \"test_client\", name: \"test\", uuid: d20b4e9b-477b-45ca-9a6a-1f6423378779, params: Null, priority: Normal, status: Queued }\n2020-04-14 16:04:33 DEBUG jobq         &gt; Message:Acknowledged(Job { id: 3000, username: \"test_client\", name: \"test\", uuid: d20b4e9b-477b-45ca-9a6a-1f6423378779, params: Null, priority: Normal, status: Queued })\n2020-04-14 16:04:39 WARN  jobq::server &gt; Job failed: 3000, Reason: Simulating failure\n2020-04-14 16:04:39 WARN  jobq::server &gt; Job failed: 2988, Reason: Simulating failure\n2020-04-14 16:04:39 WARN  jobq::server &gt; Job failed: 2976, Reason: Simulating failure\n\nYou can also run some simple stats directly against the db to see how long things have taken (hopefully ~100ms):\nselect avg(duration) from jobq;\n\n    avg     \n------------\n 0.10634147\n(1 row)\n\nConclusions\nI hope for anyone new that this article will help dip their feet into the waters of rust and async to see what can be built.\nTaking a few libraries and gluing them together we can get a pretty decent, albeit rough, outline of a background job queue.  The new async/await ecosystem while embryonic already has the tools there to build some cool stuff.\nThere will be a separate article around the release of tmq version 0.2.0 and some of the changes that have been made, but thought it might be great to provide a good example of working code before getting aroudn to that.\n","id":"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/implementing-a-jobq/","title":"Implementing a Job queue with Tokio, PostgreSQL & ZeroMQ"},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/lorikeet-0-11-0/":{"body":"I have just spent some time doing an initial async version of lorikeet now that the async/await syntax is stable and the ecosystem has caught up.  The major blocker was reqwest, as this is used extensively in the http test.\nThis async version is available now as version 0.11.0.  You can also install the cli by running cargo install lorikeet.\nWhat is Lorikeet\nLorikeet is a command line tool and a rust library to run tests for smoke testing and integration testing.  Lorikeet currently supports bash commands and simple HTTP requests along with system information (RAM, Disk &amp; CPU).  There is more information on the github readme about how to write test files, including how to structure dependent tests and make assertions on the output.\nAs a simple example, here's a test plan to check to see whether reddit is up, and then tries to login if it is:\ncheck_reddit:\n  http: https://www.reddit.com\n  regex: the front page of the internet\n\nlogin_to_reddit:\n  http: \n    url: https://www.reddit.com/api/login/{{user}}\n    form:\n      user: {{user}}\n      passwd: {{pass}}\n      api_type: json\n  jmespath: length(json.errors)\n  matches: 0\n  require:\n    - check_reddit\n\nYou can run this as a simple cli command, ensuring that you have a config.yml looks something like:\nuser: test\npass: test\n\nRunning it you will see the results:\n$ lorikeet -c config.yml test.yml\n- name: check_reddit\n  pass: true\n  output: the front page of the internet\n  duration: 1416.591ms\n\n- name: login_to_reddit\n  pass: true\n  output: 0\n  duration: 1089.0276ms\n\nSkipping futures 0.1\nIn retrospect, I am glad that I skipped out on rewriting lorikeet with the classic combinator style futures.  The migration from standard blocking code to async code is much easier than writing from combinators.  Having done the former with mpart-async, it felt quite easy to sprinkle in a few async and await statements to get things all wired up.\nAs an example, waiting for the request used to be:\nlet mut response = client\n    .execute(request.build().map_err(|err| format!(\"{:?}\", err))?)\n    .map_err(|err| format!(\"Error connecting to url {}\", err))?;\n\nNow, with async, things are not much different:\nlet response = client\n    .execute(request.build().map_err(|err| format!(\"{:?}\", err))?)\n    .await\n    .map_err(|err| format!(\"Error connecting to url {}\", err))?;\n\nUsing tokio sync primitives\nTokio has a few primitives that are very close to their std counterparts.\nLorikeet now uses a tokio mutex to record the outcome of each of the steps:\nsteps.lock().await[index] = Status::Completed(outcome);\n\nAlso using an unbounded channel so each step can inform the main runner when they are finished:\nlet (tx, mut rx) = unbounded_channel();\n\n// later on....\n\nif let Some(finished_idx) = rx.recv().await {\n  ...\n}\n\nInteresting to note that the UnboundedSender send() method is not async and does not block either.\nMultipart File Uploads\nThe new version of reqwest does not support file uploads easily.  You don't want to buffer the entire file in memory.  Luckily I have had some experience on how to wire this up with mpart-async, and can reuse some of the learnings there.\nThis does require the tokio-util crate, which bridges AsyncRead/AsyncWrite with Sink/Stream.\nThe relevent glue section is as follows:\nlet file_name = path_struct\n    .file\n    .file_name()\n    .map(|val| val.to_string_lossy().to_string())\n    .unwrap_or_default();\n\nlet file = File::open(&amp;path_struct.file)\n    .await\n    .map_err(|err| format!(\"{:?}\", err))?;\n\nlet reader = Body::wrap_stream(FramedRead::new(file, BytesCodec::new()));\n\nform.part(key, Part::stream(reader).file_name(file_name)\n\nDetecting Blocking Code\nThere is no annotation or warning whenever you are using blocking code in an async context.  This is an issue especially when porting over older code which was previously blocking.  Chances are I have missed a few sections that are blocking and will need to revisit them accordingly.\nLuckily, the fail case for blocking code is usually reduced throughput, down to the number of worker threads, so it is not cataclysmic if there are some blocking sections in your async code.\nConclusion\nI was happy with the ease at which it was to convert existing sections to async by sprinkling a few keywords here and there.  I am concerned that it is too easy to have blocking sections, so I hope there is some tooling/linting around that in the future.\nPlease give lorikeet a go and try out some of the newer features from the readme!\n","id":"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/lorikeet-0-11-0/","title":"Lorikeet 0.11.0 - Upgrading to async"},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/mpart-async-0-3-0/":{"body":"With the new std::future way of doing things and tokio slowly reaching maturation, it's time to look at updating the libraries out there that are using the old ways.  For one of my libraries, tmq, a Tokio ZeroMQ library, there is some awesome work already done to get this updated.\nBut, I thought it pertinent to at least get my feet in the water to see how hard it would be, from a library maintainer perspective, to update to std::future.  For this effort, I chose my small library: mpart-async.   You can see the changes I have made by comparing the versions here.  This blog is a small collection of notes &amp; gotches I found when porting code across.\nmpart-async is a mostly agnostic library for client side multipart/form-data requests.  There are existing libraries out there, like multipart, but I found the API a little unwieldy for my taste (That: and async support is still in alpha according to the readme). I wanted something that worked, and was simple, but didn't offer an opinion on the web client. I use both the actix client &amp;  hyper to make multipart requests depending on the project.\nThe challenge is that with multipart requests you mostly have fields &amp; binary files.  For binary files, you can appreciate, should not be buffered entirely in memory, but streamed out as the bytes become available.  So mpart-async works with multiple internal streams of files and also provides a convenience wrapper (if using tokio) for sending files given a path.\nA New Example\nAll these changes to support async fn and is it actually easier to consume/use async libraries?\nGiven the hyper example, I would say yes.\nCompare the new example:\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt; {\n    //Setup a mock server to accept connections.\n    //....\n\n    let client = Client::new();\n\n    let mut mpart = MultipartRequest::default();\n\n    mpart.add_field(\"foo\", \"bar\");\n    mpart.add_file(\"test\", \"Cargo.toml\");\n\n    let request = Request::post(\"http://localhost:3000\")\n        .header(\n            CONTENT_TYPE,\n            format!(\"multipart/form-data; boundary={}\", mpart.get_boundary()),\n        )\n        .body(Body::wrap_stream(mpart))?;\n\n    client.request(request).await?;\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n\nWith the older one:\nfn main() {\n    // current_thread::Runtime can't be used because of the blocking file operations\n    let mut rt = Runtime::new().expect(\"new rt\");\n\n    //Setup a mock server to accept connections.\n    //....\n\n    // Open `Cargo.toml` file and create a request\n    let request = File::open(\"Cargo.toml\")\n        .map_err(|e| format!(\"{}\", e))\n        .and_then(|file| {\n            // A Stream of BytesMut decoded from an AsyncRead\n            let framed = FramedRead::new(file, BytesCodec::new());\n\n            let mut mpart = MultipartRequest::default();\n            mpart.add_field(\"foo\", \"bar\");\n            mpart.add_stream(\n                \"foofile\",\n                \"Cargo.toml\",\n                \"application/toml\",\n                framed.map(|b| b.freeze()),\n            );\n            Request::post(\"http://localhost:3000\")\n                .header(\n                    CONTENT_TYPE,\n                    format!(\"multipart/form-data; boundary={}\", mpart.get_boundary()),\n                ).body(Body::wrap_stream(mpart))\n                .into_future()\n                .map_err(|e| format!(\"{}\", e))\n        });\n\n    // Send request\n    let task = request.and_then(|request| {\n        let client = hyper::Client::new();\n        client\n            .request(request)\n            .map_err(|e| format!(\"{}\", e))\n            .and_then(|response| {\n                response\n                    .into_body()\n                    .concat2()\n                    .map_err(|e| format!(\"{}\", e))\n                    .and_then(|body| {\n                        if let Ok(data) = str::from_utf8(&amp;body) {\n                            println!(\"Response: {}\", data);\n                        }\n                        Ok(())\n                    })\n            })\n    });\n\n    rt.block_on(task).expect(\"request failed\");\n}\n\nWhile there are still a few warts (such as having to manually add the boundary header), I find the code a lot more readable and easy to follow, rather than your standard combinator paths.\nNo more Error Associated Type\nThe most drastic change to the Stream trait is that there is no longer an Error associated type.  The old Stream/Future traits had both Item and Error, as it assumed that streams were always going to be fallible.  The new traits do away with the Error associated type.  Instead, if you want your Stream to possibly be an error then you need to return a Result as your Item type.\nFor the Stream trait, the method you implement has changed to poll_next and uses the std::task::Poll enum as a return type.\nThe Poll enum did feel a little inside out when I started using it, but makes sense in terms of there being no Error type.  You don't return a Result&lt;Async&lt;Option&gt;, _&gt;... you instead return a Poll&lt;Option&lt;Result&lt;_,_&gt;&gt;&gt;.\nGenerally, this means if you wrote this:\nreturn Ok(Async::Ready(Some(bytes)))\n\nYou instead will return:\nreturn Poll::Ready(Some(Ok(bytes)))\n\nStreamExt traits and friends\nAs a consequence of no Error associated type, and an example of different ergonomics, if you are dealing with Result items, you may want to use the TryStreamExt trait instead of StreamExt.  They are basically the same trait but one deals with Result a bit more nicely.  I'm not sure whether a simpler solution will be possible with higher kinded types in the future, but for now it is a tiny bit more complex than futures 0.1.\nInterestingly, the index page for stream docs doesn't currently mention that the TryStreamExt trait exists &amp; I only found out about it by asking questions in the discord chat.\nBut wait, there is also StreamExt from tokio  which is subtly different, but does as of 0.2.10 allow you to run collect() on Result&lt;Bytes, _&gt; item streams.\nWhen would you use either StreamExt?  I would say that if you want to be more general, you should probably use the futures  implementation.  Bearing in mind you can't run try_collect() on Result&lt;Bytes, _&gt; at the moment due to an outstanding issue with the bytes crate.  Why does this matter? Well, hyper passes around streams of Result&lt;Bytes, _&gt; when you are streaming a body in &amp; out of a request.  Working with this particular stream signature is a bit clunky still, but I'm sure that this will be resolved in due course.\nSo we have:\n\nStreamExt from futures that works on Stream that aren't Result\nTryStreamExt from futures that works on Stream that are Result but doesn't work well with Result&lt;Bytes,_&gt; when trying to try_collect()\nStreamExt from tokio that works with Result&lt;Bytes,_&gt; and allows you to collect() to get the output but now means you have a dependency on tokio\n\nThis might end up confusing more than just me, and I do hope that it's simplified in the future.\nLuckily in the core of the API I don't need to use them, only for tests &amp; filestream, which means I'm quite happy to depend on the tokio implementation.\nWrapping inner streams in Pin\nI got tripped up on this for a while, and needed to again ask in chat for the answer here. If you have an inner stream and you want to call poll_next on it, you need to wrap it in a Pin, otherwise the Stream trait does not stick and you will get some gnarly error message with some weird suggestions:\nThe my original shot at the code was:\nstream.stream.poll_next(cx)\n\nBut it needs to be:\nPin::new(&amp;mut stream.stream).poll_next(cx)\n\nThe compiler error message is not too helpful here, and insists I restrict S by Stream, even though it is already restricted by Stream.\nerror[E0599]: no method named `poll_next` found for type `S` in the current scope\n   --&gt; src/lib.rs:282:41\n    |\n282 |                     match stream.stream.poll_next(cx) {\n    |                                         ^^^^^^^^^ method not found in `S`\n    |\n    = help: items from traits can only be used if the type parameter is bounded by the trait\nhelp: the following trait defines an item `poll_next`, perhaps you need to restrict type parameter `S` with it:\n    |\n254 | impl&lt;E, S: futures::Stream + Stream&gt; Stream for MultipartRequest&lt;S&gt;\n    |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nYou need to make sure that your inner stream implements Unpin as well to go down this path:\nimpl&lt;E, S&gt; Stream for MultipartRequest&lt;S&gt;\nwhere\n    S: Stream&lt;Item = Result&lt;Bytes, E&gt;&gt; + Unpin,\n\nStoring the results from an async fn in a struct\nSome of the methods in tokio are returns from an async fn , like the File::open method, which I use for FileStream.  I found the answer on stack overflow as to how to do this with std::future, since async fn returns an opaque type.\nFor the older version, the OpenFuture was a concrete type:\npub struct FileStream {\n    inner: Option&lt;FramedRead&lt;File, BytesCodec&gt;&gt;,\n    file: OpenFuture&lt;PathBuf&gt;,\n}\n\nThe newer version is a return from an async fn and is opaque, so we wrap it using Box::pin:\npub struct FileStream {\n    inner: Option&lt;FramedRead&lt;File, BytesCodec&gt;&gt;,\n    file: Pin&lt;Box&lt;dyn Future&lt;Output = Result&lt;File, Error&gt;&gt; + Send + Sync&gt;&gt;,\n}\n\nYou can then instantiate this with:\nBox::pin(File::open(file.into()))\n\nThen it's easy to call passing on the context from an existing poll():\nself.file.as_mut().poll(cx)\n\nNotifying a task\nFileStream has two stages.  One is the future to open the file. The second is streaming out the bytes of the file.  When the future resolves to open the file, I want to notify the context that it should be polled again to start streaming.\nThe old way of doing this was task::current().notify():\nself.inner = Some(FramedRead::new(file, BytesCodec::new()));\ntask::current().notify();\n\nThe new way appears to be using  cx.waker().wake_by_ref() where cx is the context received from the poll:\nself.inner = Some(FramedRead::new(file, BytesCodec::new()));\ncx.waker().wake_by_ref();\n\nI say appears because the test written works without wake_by_ref() being called.  Requires a bit more investigation here I think to know exactly what's going on.  My simple test example works either way, strangely.\nConclusion\nIt is not too onerous to convert to std::future for an existing library.  I would assume the leap from the old tokio-core would be harder, as the changes feel mostly cosmetic here.\nThe omission of the Error associated type to me actually makes things less ergonomic and things a little more fragmented (as evidenced by 3 *StreamExt traits..).  I was an advocate of this initially, but there probably needs to be a bit more work in making this nicer.\nThere are still a lot of libraries out there that will be required to be updated, a lot of old blogs that are no longer relevant, and a lot of exploration that needs to be done to see how the async ecosystem falls out.  But considering the friction of updating is quite small, I am quitely optimistic!\n","id":"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/mpart-async-0-3-0/","title":"Lessons learnt updating a library to std::future"},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/rust-2019/":{"body":"2018 was a massive year for rust, and it's great to reflect back on how far we've all come.  My main wish for the new year is to put on the breaks a little bit, and finish off what has been started without taking on anything majorly new.\nThere are a couple of areas that I feel need more attention than most (purely for selfish reasons of course!):\nCompiler Times, IDE Support and RLS\nI think RLS is great.  I think cargo check is great too.  Sometimes when I am waiting for RLS to finish in VSCode, I run cargo check in a terminal to see who wins the race.  Sometimes I get results faster from the cargo check than I do in RLS.  I'm not sure why that is, it might be that I'm making a lot of small edits, and RLS is constantly restarting. I am assuming that the plumbing for both methods is rather similar.  On average, if I just adjust whitespace on one of my projects, it takes at least 10 seconds to recompile.  If I change any trivial bit of code, this doubles to 20 seconds.\nI would love to have dynamic loading in rust as a first class citizen, but I fear the ABI stabilisation is a far way off (I know you can cheat by using the C ABI and libloading but there is a fair amount of unsafe code, which I'm not comfortable with).  This would alleviate some of the issues around compilation times, by allowing compilation to be broken up into smaller chunks.\nFor instance: I implemented a WebDAV handler with actix-web.  This added a significant portion of time to compilation after the implementation was finished, and the code is mostly decoupled from the rest of the app and sits in its own little route (XML instead of JSON, etc..).  I'd love to be able to just hot-load this as a module, rather than compile it in each time if I'm not even touching this part.  Incremental compilation does help a little bit here.\nBetter IDE Support\nI have been using VSCode as my primary rust IDE for a while now, which is great, but I'd love to be able to use IntelliJ as well.  Each time there is an update, I do give it another shot, and find that there are a couple of problems with it:\n\nWeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee\nAdmittedly, each release of the IntelliJ rust plugin is better than the last, but it is not even close to the support that Java has.  I am hoping that this changes in the future.\nI'd also love to be able to give Oni a go, but currently it's in limbo until I, or someone else, has enough time to work out what is wrong with the Language Server Integration.\nAsync/Await\nI would really love to see the async/await story come to a close in 2019.  The rust team has laid the groundwork with the 2018 edition, and together with the new pinning API I feel like it's just around the corner.  This has the opportunity to really change the landscape and make rust a much more productive language.\nI've had a crack at writing both a multipart client &amp; ZeroMQ library, but I can see that when the async stuff reaches stable, it's going to make life a lot easier.   Kudos to the team for moving this forward (I also happen to think the logo for futures-rs is pretty rad!)\nDocumentation Churn\nWith these changes to async, there is going to be some challenges around documentation.  I feel in tokio-land there is a high degree of tribal knowledge that, if you don't keep up with things, you are left behind.\nThere is the new futures 0.3 crate, which is not currently in use by tokio crate, you have to use futures 0.1.  No-one knows what happened to 0.2, it's a mystery left for future rust historians, and 0.3 is still very much in alpha. Earlier on in the year if you went straight to the docs.rs page for futures, this would direct you to the 0.3 version, which isn't helpful if you are using this in conjunction with tokio (this appears to be resolved now, by some clever use of yanking).\nAnother example is the move away from tokio-core into the standard tokio crate.  This is something that is a great evolution for tokio, but has left a number of libraries outdated.  A lot of the great blogs by pioneering devs have also become outdated when dealing with this, which increases the frustration for any newcomers.  I am hoping that now things are more settled that this won't be much of an issue.\nAll of these changes adds to a high level of fatigue for developers.  If you're not lucky enough to be working in this space day-to-day, coming back after 6 months would be daunting.  There is a push to help modernise the documentation, but this hasn't seen much activity in a couple of months.  I'm hoping to find some time in the new year to help out with this, as I think there is a lot of work to be done.\nConclusion\nI think rust has come a long way and still has a long way to go.  I focused a lot of energy on writing apps in rust this year, and will undoubtably accelerate the usage as time goes on.\nI hope that the rust team has time to put on the breaks, and apply a bit of polish before doing anything major.  I also hope I have more time to contribute some bits and pieces here and there to make the community better.\n","id":"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/rust-2019/","title":"My Wishes for Rust 2019"},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/rust-2020/":{"body":"2019 was another huge year for rust, but instead of implementing the shiny new thing, it's been a focus on refining existing ideas.\nHaving being using rust professionally for over 3 years, I feel I will very soon be regailing new rust developers of the times before NLL &amp; async, where we had to play lexicon-fu to get things like caches to work in a reasonable fashion, or using super dooper combinator chains and wrestling with futures types (Either::A/B anyone?).\nSo I'd like to make clear my acknowledgement that I am happy with the direction that the rust language is heading in, and these requests are really nice to haves.\nThe Future of Futures\nThe async/await is on track to be stabilised next month, which means it's not a goal for 2020, but we have to look back to the futures-rs! There is a whole ecosystem that now needs to play catchup and I hope that it does within the year 2020.\nI also really hope they start using the logo a bit more!\n\nTokio version 1.0\nI would like to see tokio version 1.0 in 2020.  I would also like the core of tokio to be trimmed down immensely for inclusion as a dependency.  Just a small wish I know!\nI understand the reluctance to brand it as 1.0 but there is already a lot of churn from the move from tokio-core last year.  This would also signal to users that it is mostly stabilised, since async/await is dropping soon. I haven't been following development closely to know if there are any further blockers beyond this though.\nAlternatives to tokio\nI'd also like to see more than one library for async reach wide use.  I'd like to be able to mix and match executors with library code, and choose an implementation.  The promise of async/await should allow for this in theory, but we'll have to see what it's like in practice.\nThis will both add a bit of healthy competition to the ecosystem but will also prevent future design decisions from library bias.\nI know that async-std is a great contender here and I hope that one day I could use this as a (mostly) drop in replacement for running my futures.\nThis might already be possible, but I'd have no idea how to integrate this to my existing libraries (i.e, tmq and mpart-async) in an agnostic fashion.\nNon-Async stuff\nSome more care needs to be put into the non-async world.  There was a great thread about an alternative to reqwest which doesn't require the entire async stack to run.\nI would also like to see the blending of async and sync code made easier. Sometimes you want to use a db pool such as diesel, and currently that is a very messy thing to do.\nIt would be great if that bridge was seamless and doesn't shoot you in the foot (i.e, make it a compile time guarantee to ensure no blocking code in async).\nChat and Community Channels\nI really enjoyed the IRC chat room, but as Mozilla is decommissioning it, it feels like there is now a massive empty hole where a good resource use to be.\nThis isn't really something that the rust team themselves can do anything about, but I also don't think fragmenting team discussions across a variety of chat platforms sets a good precedent for the greater rust community.\nI don't have any direct qualms about using discord (which is currently recommended on the community page) but it would be preferable if whatever was chosen was both accessible and open.  I'd love it to be matrix, but riot is a bit of a clunky client, and there isn't really a better alternative client.  Discord has much more polish.\n(As an aside the fediverse stuff is pretty cool! mastodon and pixelfed are great apps and I wish we saw more rusty stuff in this space)\nReflecting on Last Year's Wishes\nMy last blog I had 3 main areas of improvement that I would like to have seen a focus on.\nCompiler Times, IDE Support and RLS\nThis is still in flux but appears to be a step in the right direction.  move over rls and welcome rust-analyzer.\nIt seems the IDE story is a lot better, but still a long way off.  Who knew it could be so hard!  IntelliJ has made strides this year in making their IDE much better.  Still though, every few months I load up some of my bigger rust projects, only to have some weirdness show up.\nI feel like this is very much an aspirational goal though, IDEs for all languages continue and improve to get better with time.  It's not ever going to be the ideal of an IDE, but it's trending towards it.\nAsync/Await\nThe Async/Await story definitely improved with the imminent release (as of this blog) of async syntax landing on stable. \nWhile there was a substantial amount of dogfooding around the syntax, I feel that the language team has settled on an appropriate solution.  It looks a bit weird at first, but the promise of having match or others use the same syntax style is intruiging.\nDocumentation Churn\nThis is still an area of concern, but has been addressed mostly in some of the frameworks I've seen.  I feel like this won't be fixed until all the ecosystem has stabilised around new language features and we land a few more 1.0 crates.\nIt's going to be a hassle redoing examples with async keywords!\nConclusion\nI am happy with the way things have progressed throughout 2019 and I feel that 2020 is going to be a massively exciting time for rust.\nI don't feel there is a need for another epoch just yet, considering we're still working through the current one.\nLet's work towards polishing the async ecosystem for this year, and hopefully we'll have a very compelling story for everyone else to get involved.\n","id":"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/rust-2020/","title":"My Wishes for Rust 2020"},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/sharing-types-with-the-frontend/":{"body":"When building in a strongly-typed language such as rust it's a shame to have to throw this strictness away, especially when dealing with the wild west of frontend stacks. The bigger the project is, the more you want to keep things cohesive.\nThis cohesion evaporates quickly when you need to pass language barriers. While normal JavaScript does not have types, we can utilise TypeScript to share this type information and hopefully maintain some cohesion between languages.\nThe scenario we're targeting here is writing a web backend in rust, and having those types/methods available easily for a TypeScript enabled frontend. This article describes a few common methods we can bridge the two languages together using currently available tools and libraries. Most of them follow similar characteristics, but each approach has their own set of tradeoffs.\nThis blog will primarily use actix-web as the example for the web backend, as it is one I'm most familiar with, but the libraries used here do have support for other backends.\nDerive Macros\nStrictly speaking, all these methods use derive macros in some way, but what I am describing here is using derive macros to publish structs/objects as typescript definitions. These don't include function/methods or http requests (which will be discussed later on).\nRust does not have runtime reflection built into the language &amp; so relies on decorating types via macros to provide some sort of approximate \"reflection\".\nIn terms of the two main derive macro libraries to choose from, we have ts-rs and schemars. Both of these libraries are integrated tightly with serde.\nts-rs\nThe ts-rs library will allow you to output typescript types for your existing objects:\n#[derive(TS)]\n#[ts(export)]\nstruct User {\n    user_id: i32,\n    first_name: String,\n    last_name: String,\n}\n\nThe #[ts(export)] attribute will export this type when you run cargo test on your crate.\nBy default this will be in the bindings/ directory, with a separate typescript file per object type:\nexport interface User {\n  user_id: number;\n  first_name: string;\n  last_name: string;\n}\n\nAlternatively, you can use the TS::decl() method to export it as a String.\nfn main() {\n    println!(\"{}\", User::decl());\n}\n\nschemars\nNow, schemars does not export to typescript directly, but will export to JSON Schema which can be consumed &amp; converted into typescript with the help of conversion tools.\nWorking similar to ts-rs, you can derive JsonSchema on your objects:\n#[derive(JsonSchema)]\nstruct User {\n    user_id: i32,\n    first_name: String,\n    last_name: String,\n}\n\nFrom there, you can print out the schema with the help the schema_for macro &amp; serde_json:\nfn main() {\n    let schema = schema_for!(User);\n    println!(\"{}\", serde_json::to_string_pretty(&amp;schema).unwrap());\n}\n\nWith this schema in hand, you can use a tool like json-schema-to-typescript to output it as typescript types:\n$ cargo run | npx json-schema-to-typescript\n\n/* tslint:disable */\n/**\n * This file was automatically generated by json-schema-to-typescript.\n * DO NOT MODIFY IT BY HAND.

If your backend is a web server, it's great to auto-generate the appropriate typescript code for making HTTP API calls. Luckily, if you can generate an OpenAPI spec, you can auto-generate clients for use in the frontend, all typed and ready to go!\nDepending on your backend web framework will dictate what support there are for this method. There is a push for the most common web frameworks to have OpenAPI support with varying states of maturity.\nPaperclip and Actix Web\nThis method is one I am most familiar with, using paperclip with an actix-web backend. The paperclip crate allows you to annotate structs &amp; request methods to have it auto-generate an OpenAPI spec for you:\nuse actix_web::{App, Error, HttpServer};\nuse paperclip::actix::{\n    api_v2_operation,\n    web::{self, Json},\n    Apiv2Schema, OpenApiExt,\n};\nuse serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};\n\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Apiv2Schema)]\nstruct User {\n    user_id: i32,\n    first_name: String,\n    last_name: String,\n}\n\n#[api_v2_operation]\nasync fn echo_user(body: Json&lt;User&gt;) -&gt; Result&lt;Json&lt;User&gt;, Error&gt; {\n    Ok(body)\n}\n\n#[actix_web::main]\nasync fn main() -&gt; std::io::Result&lt;()&gt; {\n    HttpServer::new(|| {\n        App::new()\n            .wrap_api()\n            .service(web::resource(\"/echo\").route(web::post().to(echo_user)))\n            .with_json_spec_v3_at(\"/api/spec/v3\")\n            .build()\n    })\n    .bind(\"127.0.0.1:8080\")?\n    .run()\n    .await\n}\n\nNow, you can curl to retrieve the json spec:\ncurl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/spec/v3\n\n{\n  \"openapi\": \"3.0.0\",\n  \"info\": { \"title\": \"\", \"version\": \"\" },\n  \"paths\": {\n    \"/echo\": {\n      \"post\": {\n        \"requestBody\": {\n          \"content\": {\n            \"application/json\": {\n              \"schema\": { \"$ref\": \"#/components/schemas/User\" }\n            }\n          },\n          \"required\": true\n        },\n        \"responses\": {\n          \"200\": {\n            \"description\": \"OK\",\n            \"content\": {\n              \"application/json\": {\n                \"schema\": { \"$ref\": \"#/components/schemas/User\" }\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"components\": {\n    \"schemas\": {\n      \"User\": {\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"first_name\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n          \"last_name\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n          \"user_id\": { \"type\": \"integer\", \"format\": \"int32\" }\n        },\n        \"required\": [\"first_name\", \"last_name\", \"user_id\"]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nHowever, if you're like me and would like it written out to a file rather than rely on a backend to be running, you can do so with a little bit of fiddling around.\nFirstly, we want to create a function to configure our services:\nfn config(cfg: &amp;mut web::ServiceConfig) {\n    cfg.service(web::resource(\"/echo\").route(web::post().to(echo_user)));\n}\n\nThen we can adjust our main app to use this to configure actix web:\nApp::new()\n    .wrap_api()\n    .configure(config)\n    .with_json_spec_v3_at(\"/api/spec/v3\")\n    .build()\n\nAnd we can create another function that will write out the api spec to a file:\npub fn dump_schema&lt;P: AsRef&lt;Path&gt;&gt;(path: P) {\n    App::new()\n        .wrap_api()\n        .configure(config)\n        .with_raw_json_spec_v3(|app, spec| {\n            let mut file = File::create(&amp;path).expect(\"Could not create a file\");\n            file.write_all(\n                serde_json::to_string_pretty(&amp;spec)\n                    .expect(\"Could not serialize spec\")\n                    .as_bytes(),\n            )\n            .expect(\"Could not write schema\");\n\n            app\n        });\n}\n\nThe reason we keep it separate from the main App builder inside the HttpServer closure is that the builder will be called per worker &amp; so as you can imagine it would write out the file multiple times on server startup.\nNow we can call it manually:\ndump_schema(\"openapi.json\");\n\nUtoipa\nMore general purpose and targeting a number of different web frameworks, the utoipa library is similar in function to paperclip, albeit with a little bit more boilerplate to get going.\nAs before, a derive macro ToSchema handles the straight type magic:\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, ToSchema)]\nstruct User {\n    user_id: i32,\n    first_name: String,\n    last_name: String,\n}\n\nDecorating services is a little more cumbersome, as we need to specify the request &amp; response types alongside a status.\nHere's an actix web example:\n#[utoipa::path(post, request_body = User, responses((status = 200, body = User)))]\n#[post(\"/echo\")]\nasync fn echo_user(body: Json&lt;User&gt;) -&gt; Result&lt;Json&lt;User&gt;, Error&gt; {\n    Ok(body)\n}\n\nYou can see, that the User type has to be repeated in both the request_body and body attributes. This could potentially mean that the generated OpenAPI specification does not match reality, so extra care is needed to ensure they match.\nIt would be nice if the proc macro could work this out by itself rather than having to redefine them in attributes, but it would require tighter integration, something that might be added in the future.\nGenerating a OpenAPI JSON file is a little bit easier than in paperclip.\nFirstly you combine all your components on a struct:\n#[derive(OpenApi)]\n#[openapi(components(schemas(User)), paths(echo_user))]\nstruct ApiDoc;\n\nThen you can use some standard methods to write it out:\nstd::fs::write(\n    \"openapi.json\",\n    &amp;ApiDoc::openapi()\n        .to_pretty_json()\n        .expect(\"Should serialize\"),\n)?;\n\nTypeScript from OpenAPI\nWith an openapi.json file you can use a tool such as openapi-generator-cli to generate the requisite definitions:\nnpx openapi-generator-cli generate -i openapi.json -g typescript\n\nThis won't create purely typescript definitions, as there still needs to be a library to make requests and you may want to generate types closer to your frontend framework like using typescript-rxjs etc...\nNormally this isn't run individually, but rather it is included inside package.json of an existing frontend project.\nGraphQL\nGraphQL can be used to publish types, albeit indirectly and does require you to modify your backend to support it. The types that can be represented in GraphQL are also quite restricted: no recursive types, no shared types between input/output, incomplete support for sum-types/unions to name a few issues I've personally hit using it. If you're happy with the high level of opinionation GraphQL forces upon your code base, you are rewarded with some great tooling &amp; infrastructure.\nThe main two libraries for GraphQL on the backend are async-graphql and juniper.\nOn the frontend, there is similar tooling to OpenAPI for generating types &amp; requests. You will, however, need to also write out some specific GraphQL queries, to utilise them.\nasync-graphql\nAs with the Derive Macro &amp; OpenAPI generators you start by decorating your structs. We can use the SimpleObject and InputObject derive macros (in GraphQL you need separate types for input...):\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, SimpleObject)]\nstruct User {\n    user_id: i32,\n    first_name: String,\n    last_name: String,\n}\n\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, InputObject)]\nstruct UserInput {\n    user_id: i32,\n    first_name: String,\n    last_name: String,\n}\n\nNext, we want to define a Query object which will dictate the methods available via GraphQL:\npub struct Query;\n\n#[Object]\nimpl Query {\n    async fn echo_user(&amp;self, user: UserInput) -&gt; User {\n        User {\n            user_id: user.user_id,\n            first_name: user.first_name,\n            last_name: user.last_name,\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThen we can set up a handler for graphql queries (leaving subscriptions and mutations empty for now):\nasync fn graphql_handler(\n    schema: web::Data&lt;Schema&lt;Query, EmptyMutation, EmptySubscription&gt;&gt;,\n    request: GraphQLRequest,\n) -&gt; GraphQLResponse {\n    schema.execute(request.into_inner()).await.into()\n}\n\nAnd a GraphiQL endpoint to use a browser to craft graphql queries:\nasync fn graphql_playground() -&gt; HttpResponse {\n    HttpResponse::Ok()\n        .content_type(\"text/html; charset=utf-8\")\n        .body(GraphiQLSource::build().endpoint(\"/graphql\").finish())\n}\n\nWe wrap the schema in web::Data and add it as app_data, then provide our two new services:\n#[actix_web::main]\nasync fn main() -&gt; std::io::Result&lt;()&gt; {\n    let schema = Schema::build(Query, EmptyMutation, EmptySubscription).finish();\n    let schema_data = web::Data::new(schema);\n\n    HttpServer::new(move || {\n        App::new()\n            .app_data(schema_data.clone())\n            .service(web::resource(\"/graphql\").route(web::post().to(graphql_handler)))\n            .service(web::resource(\"/playground\").route(web::get().to(graphql_playground)))\n    })\n    .bind(\"127.0.0.1:8080\")?\n    .run()\n    .await\n}\n\nYou can also write out the schema via the sdl() method on Schema:\nstd::fs::write(\"example.graphql\", schema.sdl())?;\n\nGraphiQL Playground\nNavigating to http://localhost:8080/playground in a browser you will get the GraphiQL playground:\n\njuniper\nThe juniper crate in this context is very similar to async-graphql.\njuniper as a crate has been around a fair bit longer async-graphql &amp; did not start off as an async library. Both are very capable libraries, but I have found async-graphql to be better documented, and more \"modern\".\nIn terms of coding for our example, juniper is very similar to async-graphql, with derive macros on the types you want to define:\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, GraphQLObject)]\nstruct User {\n    user_id: i32,\n    first_name: String,\n    last_name: String,\n}\n\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, GraphQLInputObject)]\nstruct UserInput {\n    user_id: i32,\n    first_name: String,\n    last_name: String,\n}\n\n\nThe query object is also very much a slot in:\npub struct Query;\n\n#[juniper::graphql_object]\nimpl Query {\n    async fn echo_user(&amp;self, user: UserInput) -&gt; User {\n        User {\n            user_id: user.user_id,\n            first_name: user.first_name,\n            last_name: user.last_name,\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nCreating the schema is also similar:\nlet schema = Schema::new(Query, EmptyMutation::new(), EmptySubscription::new());\n\nThe handler method deviates slightly, but is mostly the same as above:\nasync fn graphql(\n    req: actix_web::HttpRequest,\n    payload: actix_web::web::Payload,\n    schema: web::Data&lt;Schema&gt;,\n) -&gt; Result&lt;HttpResponse, Error&gt; {\n    graphql_handler(&amp;schema, &amp;(), req, payload).await\n}\n\nThe juniper_actix integration also provides a graphiql_handler which you can use to mount the playground (v1 of graphiql instead of v2 at this time of writing).\nPutting this together, we get almost an identical layout:\n#[actix_web::main]\nasync fn main() -&gt; std::io::Result&lt;()&gt; {\n    let schema = Schema::new(Query, EmptyMutation::new(), EmptySubscription::new());\n    let schema_data = web::Data::new(schema);\n\n    HttpServer::new(move || {\n        App::new()\n            .app_data(schema_data.clone())\n            .service(web::resource(\"/graphql\").route(web::post().to(graphql)))\n            .service(\n                web::resource(\"/playground\")\n                    .route(web::get().to(|| graphiql_handler(\"/graphql\", None))),\n            )\n    })\n    .bind(\"127.0.0.1:8080\")?\n    .run()\n    .await\n}\n\nAs with async-graphql the graphql schema can be written out to disk using the as_schema_language() method:\nstd::fs::write(\"example.graphql\", schema.as_schema_language())?;\n\nGraphQL to TypeScript\nNow, the next question is: we have our graphql schema, how do we get to typescript definitions? The easiest way I've found, from a maintenance perspective, is a little bit involved for this particular blog. The gist is that using GraphQL Code Generator you can define your queries and then have frontend methods/types generated from them.\nThis does require a bit of scaffolding in your frontend project to get working, but is rather painless when it is set up, besides having to write queries/mutations for all of your types.\nConclusions\nAs you can see there are a variety of ways of publishing rust types for use within TypeScript. Having this process is as automated as possible is a great way to icnrease cohesion between front &amp; backend. Whether these methods are right for you depends entirely on your use-case &amp; what tradeoffs you're willing to make:\nTypes Only: You can use direct translation tools such as ts-rs or schemars\nOpenAPI: You can go the OpenAPI route using paperclip or utoipa\nGraphQL: You can use GraphQL with async-graphql or juniper\nWhen building DiveDB, I opted to use GraphQL due to its great frontend tooling &amp; standardised introspection. In future blogs I hope to dive into some of the details of this decision.\n","id":"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/sharing-types-with-the-frontend/","title":"Publishing Rust types to a TypeScript frontend"},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/synchronising-with-websocket/":{"body":"At formlogic, we are using rust for a number of components within our tech stack, including: internal and external web applications, coordinating and logging machining workflows, parsing an industrial domain specific language (G-Code), and more.\nOne of the challenges we faced early on was we had state that needed to be synchronized between rust applications, browsers and the database itself. We wanted to make sure that everyone could subscribe to state changes and everyone could have the same view. We also wanted the ability to roll back state, but preserve history i.e, have an append only immutable event log, while also being able to extend the structure of our state if we choose to in the future.\nThis blog will step through one possible solution for this challenge using a combination of WebSockets for transport and JSON Patch for describing changes to an arbitrary structure.\nTo provide an example of this, we'll be building up everyone's favourite Todo Application: a list of todos with a mark to say whether they're completed or not. However, our version will ensure that all connected clients will, in close to real time, have updates shown.\nFor those wanting to skip ahead and see the finished product, you can view the source here.\n\nWhat is JSON Patch\nJSON Patch is an RFC standard for describing patch updates to an arbitrary JSON structure.\nFor instance, if you had a JSON object that looked like this:\n{\n  \"name\": \"Hello\"\n}\n\nAnd a patch that looks like this:\n[\n  {\n    \"op\": \"replace\",\n    \"path\": \"/name\",\n    \"value\": \"Hello World!\"\n  }\n]\n\nThen applying this patch, your object will now look like this:\n{\n  \"name\": \"Hello World!\"\n}\n\nAnother way to think about it, is that JSON Patch can encode transitions of state, and can be considered a lightweight form of event sourcing.\nThere are a number of libraries available in all languages, including rust and for browsers, and as the format itself is just JSON, it makes it easy to save the patches themselves in jsonb column on your database.\nJSON Patch does not, by itself, enforce any schema for the JSON document. There are some operations that can cause an error if applied incorrectly, such as out of bounds replacements in arrays, but nothing that enforces that the end result is what you are expecting. For that purpose we're going to leverage serde for its great type safety, ensuring our state is in the shape we want.\nWebSockets and Updates\nWith JSON Patch we have a stream of changes to a structure we can act upon, but how do we transport it? Well, since we want browsers to be a part of this as well, a great candidate is WebSockets. WebSockets are a great way to stream things into a frontend without having the overhead of having a HTTP Connection per message. This channel can stay open for as long as the browser is open. We can receive also messages in near real time: only network latency and a bit of decoding act as a bottleneck.\nLuckily WebSocket support is not only a feature of backend frameworks, but also has clients suited to connecting as well. We'll only be investigating browsers in this blog for brevity, but one could easily expand it to use something like tokio-tungstenite to consume our messages in rust.\nRust Backend\nFor brevity's sake we will choose axum as the backend, and their websockets example as the base. For this example to build by itself, there are a few dependent crates:\naxum = { version = \"0.6.4\", features = [\"ws\"]}\ntokio = { version = \"1\", features = [\"full\"] }\n\nThe ws feature adds in websocket support to axum, otherwise all we'll use the defaults\nFor debug logs, we'll use tracing with tracing-subscriber to get things logged nicely to stderr:\ntracing = \"0.1.37\"\ntracing-subscriber = \"0.3.16\"\n\nAnd for our example we're going to use serde and serde_json for serialization, with json-patch as mentioned above. We'll also include the futures crate, as we'll see that comes in use later when we want to split the rx/tx of a websocket channel:\nserde = { version = \"1.0\", features = [\"derive\"] }\nserde_json = \"1.0\"\nfutures = \"0.3\"\njson-patch = \"0.3.0\"\n\nThe Main Method\nWith the main method we want to instantiate some logging, set up our routes for our web app &amp; then serve on a port. While the initial example includes some static file hosting, we will skip those routes for brevity and only include the websocket route.\nOur main function becomes quite concise:\nasync fn main() {\n\n    // Set a sensible default for logging to ensure we see something\n    if std::env::var_os(\"RUST_LOG\").is_none() {\n        std::env::set_var(\"RUST_LOG\", \"websocket_jsonpatch=debug\")\n    }\n\n    // Initialise the `fmt` subscriber which will print logs to stderr\n    tracing_subscriber::fmt::init();\n\n    // Add in our application with the websocket handler\n    let app = Router::new()\n        .route(\"/ws\", get(ws_handler))\n        // Add in a shared websocket state struct `WsState`\n        .layer(Extension(Arc::new(WsState::new())));\n\n    // Listen on port 3333 for connections\n    let addr: SocketAddr = \"127.0.0.1:3333\".parse().unwrap();\n\n    debug!(\"Listening for requests on {}\", addr);\n\n    // Start up the server\n    axum::Server::bind(&amp;addr)\n        .serve(app.into_make_service())\n        .await\n        .unwrap();\n}\n\nThe Todo Struct\nLet's start shaping our todo struct:\n\nWe want to name a todo list itself, such as Shopping List or Writing a blog about Rust. This also gives us an easy thing to update in the structure.\nWe want a list of entries, which have a name and a boolean as to whether they are marked Completed or not.\nWe want some convenience derives such as for serialization with serde and sensible defaults.\n\nWith that in mind, we have the main Todo struct:\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Default, Debug, Clone)]\npub struct Todo {\n    // The main name of the todo list\n    name: String,\n    // The list of todos\n    todos: BTreeMap&lt;u32, TodoRow&gt;,\n}\n\nAnd each Row has the following shape:\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Default, Debug, Clone)]\npub struct TodoRow {\n    // The name of the specific todo\n    name: String,\n    // Whether this todo is completed or not\n    completed: bool,\n}\n\nA Note on using a BTreeMap instead of a Vec\nAn initial version of this blog included todos as a Vec&lt;TodoRow&gt;, but that was found to be quite noisy when clearing out completed todos. Refactoring this to use a BTreeMap instead took not long at all, and is a testament to this design being malleable. Readers are invited to adjust this shape back to a Vec or provide other fields/values to see how to make such a change.\nMaking Changes\nIf you have used the redux pattern before, you would be familiar with use actions to mutate state. We'll build something similar here, to make it easier to describe the intent of the change and to have all the logic in one module. These actions are what are going to be sent from the browser or other clients.\nWhen actions are received, the todo state is changed, and we generate a diff between the old and new JSON, which is then sent over the wire back to the frontend in the form of JSON Patches.\nThese changes are executed in serial by means of a held mutex, rather than allow concurrent updates to the state. We'll also only have one \"todo\" list, but could imagine an easy extension to have multiple different lists, each with their own changes. For concurrency without making changes serial, a CRDT like automerge could be a suitable candidate. In practice, we've found that, when given a low concurrent user count per JSON object, the simplicity and auditability of JSON patches is a great trade-off.\nActions\nWe're going to have a few actions that are available to use (all of which should be self-descriptive):\n#[derive(Deserialize)]\n#[serde(tag = \"type\")]\npub enum TodoAction {\n    Add { row: TodoRow },\n    ChangeName { name: String },\n    Update { index: u32, row: TodoRow },\n    Remove { index: u32 },\n    RemoveCompleted,\n}\n\nWe are using a tag to make it easier to define these in TypeScript later on. Serde will use a field named type to store the enum variant.\nWith those actions, we can then use them to apply to our Todo struct and update the state:\nimpl Todo {\n    pub fn apply(&amp;mut self, action: TodoAction) {\n        match action {\n            TodoAction::Add { row } =&gt; {\n                // Find the next available index\n                let index = self.todos.keys().max().copied().unwrap_or_default() + 1;\n\n                // Insert this into our map\n                self.todos.insert(index, row);\n            }\n            TodoAction::Update { row, index } =&gt; {\n                self.todos.insert(index, row);\n            }\n            // Change the name of the todo list\n            TodoAction::ChangeName { name } =&gt; self.name = name,\n            TodoAction::Remove { index } =&gt; {\n                self.todos.remove(&amp;index);\n            }\n            // Filter and remove all completed todo rows\n            TodoAction::RemoveCompleted =&gt; self.todos.retain(|_, val| !val.completed),\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWebSockets\nWe are going to use websockets as our primary means of communication between the front and backend, providing a bi-directional channel with which we can send messages.\nShared WsState\nIn the main() function, we added a reference counted WsState struct via AddExtensionLayer. This represents our shared state between all websocket sessions.\nInside this struct, we are going to keep two things:\n\nThe Todo struct as per our modelling above inside a tokio Mutex\nA list of websocket sinks that we can send updates to. So when one session makes a change, it is reflected on all other sessions.\n\nThis struct looks like so:\npub struct WsState {\n    // Our main state, behind a tokio Mutex\n    todo: Mutex&lt;Todo&gt;,\n    // A list of sessions we will send changes to\n    txs: Mutex&lt;Vec&lt;SplitSink&lt;WebSocket, Message&gt;&gt;&gt;,\n}\n\nAdding Sessions\nWhen we add a session, we want to send a full state to get it caught up, and then add it to our list:\nasync fn add_session(&amp;self, tx: SplitSink&lt;WebSocket, Message&gt;) {\n    // Get a mutable lock of our transactions\n    let mut txs = self.txs.lock().await;\n\n    // Send the initial state update\n    if let Err(err) = tx\n        .send(Message::Text(\n            // This method will not fail in \"normal\" operations so an `expect()` is OK here\n            serde_json::to_string(&amp;ServerMessage::Full {\n                todo: &amp;*self.todo.lock().await,\n            })\n            .expect(\"Serialize Error\"),\n        ))\n        .await\n    {\n        warn!(\"Could not send initial state update: {}\", err);\n        return;\n    }\n    // Add session to our list of sessions\n    txs.push(tx);\n}\n\nApplying State Changes\nOn WsState we'll create a method called apply which takes a TodoAction and applies this to the state, then broadcasts changes to all connected sessions. We'll break this method down as there is a lot happening here.\nThe signature of this method looks like this:\nasync fn apply(&amp;self, action: TodoAction) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt; {\n\n    ...\n}\n\nThe first thing we need to do is grab a mutable reference to our existing state:\nlet mut state = self.todo.lock().await;\n\nThen we want to get a copy of the state as it stands currently, but as a serde_json::Value which we can use to diff:\nlet existing_json = serde_json::to_value(&amp;*state)?;\n\nAfter we have our existing_json, we can use the Todo::apply() method to mutate the value:\n// Apply the action to our todo list.  This mutates it in place\nstate.apply(action);\n\nWith that applied, we can grab the new state as a Value as well:\n// Serialize out the new JSON for diffing\nlet new_json = serde_json::to_value(&amp;*state)?;\n\nThen, we can use the diff method from json_patch to automatically generate the patches needed to go from the existing to the new state:\n// Get the changes using the `diff` method from `json_patch`\nlet ops = diff(&amp;existing_json, &amp;new_json).0;\n\nWith this, you'll notice we are quite agnostic to what the shape is of the state, and how the state changes. All we need to be able to do is serialize it before and after, and we can completely change the structure internally. A further excercise would be to generalize this method to accept anything that implements Serialize\nOk, we have a list of patches, let's print them out so we can inspect them:\ndebug!(\"New Patches:{:?}\", ops);\n\nBroadcasting Our Changes\nGenerating changes to state is one half of this method, the other half is to broadcast this out to every session.\nWe will first check whether there were any changes worth broadcasting, and then will serialize it to a string\n// If there are no changes, don't bother broadcasting\nif !ops.is_empty() {\n\n    // Serialize it to a json string here\n    let message = serde_json::to_string(&amp;ServerMessage::Patch { ops })?;\n\n    ...\n}\n\nThe next thing we want to do is grab all of our sessions and lock them for the time being:\nlet mut txs = self.txs.lock().await;\n\nNow, some session between now and the last broadcast could have gone away.\nWhat we are going to do is take all the sessions out of the existing vec, replacing it with an empty one using std::mem:take(), and then try sending to each session. If there is no issue sending, we add it back to the list.\nIf there is an issue sending, we will log the error but not add it back, to be dropped/cleaned up when the object is out of scope:\n// We take all the txs to iterate, and replace with an empty `Vec`\nfor mut tx in mem::take(&amp;mut *txs) {\n    // If there is an issue sending a message we will warn about it\n    if let Err(err) = tx.send(Message::Text(message.clone())).await {\n        warn!(\"Client disconnected: {}\", err);\n    // If there is no issue sending, then we add it back to our `Vec`\n    } else {\n        txs.push(tx)\n    }\n}\n\nAnd then we're done! To recap, when applying changes we first generate a list of patches to apply. We then send that list to all the connected sessions, cleaning up any erroneous sessions in the process.\nAxum Websocket Interface\nAxum provides a WebSocketUpgrade struct, with which you can feed it a function (or closure) to start an async task when the websocket upgrade happens. We use this to feed in our WsState value (behind an Arc):\nasync fn ws_handler(\n    ws: WebSocketUpgrade,\n    Extension(state): Extension&lt;Arc&lt;WsState&gt;&gt;,\n) -&gt; impl IntoResponse {\n    debug!(\"New Websocket Connection\");\n    ws.on_upgrade(|socket| handle_socket(socket, state))\n}\n\nServer Messages\nTo keep things simple we will have an enum of possible messages the server/backend can send to clients. There are going to be only two types: a list of patches to apply or a full todo struct. When clients first connect, we need to get them caught up with the current state of the world, so we send them the full state.\n#[derive(Serialize, Debug)]\n#[serde(tag = \"type\")]\nenum ServerMessage&lt;'a&gt; {\n    Patch { ops: Vec&lt;PatchOperation&gt; },\n    Full { todo: &amp;'a Todo },\n}\n\nAs per the TodoAction we'll use a type tag for ease of integration with TypeScript. Also notice that we will be able to send multiple patches in one message. This is for in the case of a change causing a cascade of patches, such as when removing completed items in the todo list.\nThis ServerMessage enum will be serialized on the wire as JSON. Websockets support standard text messages, as well as binary types. A further exercise would be to use a different encoding, such as CBOR, but does make things a bit less human readable\nHandle Socket\nOur handle_socket method is responsible for initiating new session &amp; feeding that session into the WsState struct.\npub async fn handle_socket(socket: WebSocket, state: Arc&lt;WsState&gt;) {\n    // Magic happens here\n}\n\nFirstly, we'll split up the websocket into a tx/rx pair. We'll have the handle_socket hold onto the rx part, and move the tx into the WsState value. If you have a struct that implements Stream and Sink you can use futures and StreamExt to split this into two separate objects, with separate ownership of both.\nlet (tx, mut rx) = socket.split();\n\nWe'll then add this session to our shared state:\nstate.add_session(tx).await;\n\nThis method will fire off a ServerMessage::Full with the current state, returning early if this fails\nThen, we simply loop any messages received from the client &amp; apply them to our shared state. The type of messages we receive from the client will be our TodoAction enum.\nTo loop while there are messages, we can use the following let binding:\nwhile let Some(Ok(msg)) = rx.next().await {\n    ...\n}\n\nThis loop will terminate if there are no more messages to receive (i.e, the stream is finished and returning None), and if there are any errors receiving messages.\nInside the loop, we decode the message as JSON, and throw a warning if it's a message we're not expecting. We then apply that message to our shared state. As above, the shared state will in turn broadcast out JSON patches to update the state:\n// Loop until there are no messages or an error\nwhile let Some(Ok(msg)) = rx.next().await {\n    if let Message::Text(text) = msg {\n        // Decode our message and warn if it's something we don't know about\n        if let Ok(action) = serde_json::from_str::&lt;TodoAction&gt;(&amp;text) {\n            // Apply the state, which will broadcast out changes as a JSON patch\n            if let Err(err) = state.apply(action).await {\n                warn!(\"Error applying state:{}\", err);\n            }\n        } else {\n            warn!(\"Unknown action received:{}\", text);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nOk! So we have the shape of our data, some actions to mutate the state and some scaffolding to wire up the websockets. What's next is to build the frontend.\nReact Frontend\nWe're going to build a companion browser application to use our backend. This will be built in react, but could be built using any framework, or even vanilla javascript. Vite will be the build tool of choice, given it has a fast development feedback loop and supports React/TypeScript. For styling, we'll use spectre.css to make it look a little better than the standard style and provide some responsivness. You can create a new vite project by running:\nyarn create vite front --template react-ts\n\nWe'll want to run the rust backend in another terminal window with:\ncargo run\n\nAnd then we want to proxy all requests to /ws to the backend which we can do by changing the vite.config.ts:\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [react()],\n  server: {\n    proxy: {\n      \"/ws\": {\n        target: \"http://127.0.0.1:3333\",\n        ws: true,\n      },\n    },\n  },\n});\n\nWith that in place, we can yarn dev to get up a developer window.\nTodo Structure\nWe want to have the todo structure imitate what's in the backend. For brevity here we'll just write them by hand, but there does exist tools to have these structures generated automatically (see the blog: Publishing Rust types to a TypeScript frontend).\nStarting off with the Todo struct itself:\nexport interface Todo {\n  name: string;\n  todos: { [index: number]: TodoRow };\n}\n\nexport interface TodoRow {\n  id: number;\n  name: string;\n  completed: boolean;\n}\n\nThen, we deviate a little bit with the actions. In the backend we have used a tagged enum with the type property to define what action is in use. In typescript, we will use a Discriminated Union pattern to define these actions in a compatible way:\nexport interface Add {\n  type: \"Add\";\n  row: TodoRow;\n}\n\nexport interface ChangeName {\n  type: \"ChangeName\";\n  name: string;\n}\n\nexport interface Update {\n  type: \"Update\";\n  row: TodoRow;\n  index: number;\n}\n\nexport interface Remove {\n  type: \"Remove\";\n  index: number;\n}\n\nexport interface RemoveCompleted {\n  type: \"RemoveCompleted\";\n}\n\nexport type TodoAction = Add | ChangeName | Update | Remove | RemoveCompleted;\n\nWebsocket Component\nFor the Websocket component, we'll cheat a little bit and use some global variables to hold around both the websocket connection itself &amp; the shared state. Using react hooks we'll integrate with components to allow state changes to come through.\nFirstly, we define our server messages as per the backend. We'll be using the same Discriminated Union pattern.\ninterface Patch {\n  type: \"Patch\";\n  // `Operation` from `fast-json-patch` module\n  ops: Operation[];\n}\n\ninterface Full {\n  type: \"Full\";\n  todo: Todo;\n}\n\ntype ServerMessage = Patch | Full;\n\nThen, let's set up our global variables:\nlet websocket: WebSocket | undefined;\nlet todo: Todo | undefined;\n\nWe use undefined to indicate those values aren't initialised. Both the websocket &amp; the todo itself are initialised at different times.\nThen, we'll create a setupWebsocket function which will handle the connection &amp; and plumbing needed to send and receive messages. We'll want to have a callback function to accept a new todo object which we'll use to integrate into react hooks later.\nSo with the the signature looks like the following:\nconst setupWebsocket = (onTodoUpdate: (todo: Todo) =&gt; void) =&gt; {\n   ...\n}\n\nThen we want to create a new WebSocket, but we need to pass it a valid uri. Websockets use ws:// instead of http:// and wss:// instead of https:// for their URLs, so we'll split apart the current window.location and use components of it to build our uri:\nconst loc = window.location;\nconst uri = `${loc.protocol === \"https:\" ? \"wss:\" : \"ws:\"}//${loc.host}/ws`;\nconsole.log(`Connecting websocket: ${uri}`);\n\nconst connection = new WebSocket(uri);\n\nOk, with our connection created we will need to listen to different events, and execute accordingly.\nFirstly, when the connection is opened, we'll log that its connected and then set our global websocket variable equal to this connection:\nconnection.onopen = () =&gt; {\n  console.log(\"Websocket Connected\");\n  websocket = connection;\n};\n\nNow, there is a case that a websocket connection drops while you have the page open. We want to recover from this somewhat gracefully, retrying the connection until it's successful.\nOne way of doing this is to re-execute the setupWebsocket method after a bit of time has passed, and that's what we'll do here, retry the setup after half a second has passed. If the websocket has closed gracefully, then we don't bother retrying:\n// If we receive a close event the backend has gone away, we try reconnecting in a bit of time\nconnection.onclose = (reason) =&gt; {\n  websocket = undefined;\n\n  // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CloseEvent\n  if (reason.code !== 1000 &amp;&amp; reason.code !== 1001) {\n    console.error(\"Websocket connection closed\", reason);\n\n    setTimeout(() =&gt; {\n      setupWebsocket(onTodoUpdate);\n    }, 500);\n  }\n};\n\nThen, if there is an error with the websocket we can log what that error is, then close it\nconnection.onerror = (error) =&gt; {\n  console.error(\"Error with websocket\", error);\n  connection.close();\n};\n\nOk with the websocket life cycle out of the way, now comes to the meat of our event loop. What we're going to do is listen for server events, and if either type is received, act accordingly:\n\nFor the Full server message, the todo object will be replaced outright.\nFor the Patch, we will use the fast-json-patch module to mutate todo in place, and then execute our callback:\n\nWhatever the type of message, the full todo object is provided to the callback, with the patch merging logic happening here, and shielded from our callback update.\nconnection.onmessage = (message) =&gt; {\n  // Parse the message via JSON, asserting what we'll get from the backend\n  const msg = JSON.parse(message.data) as ServerMessage;\n\n  switch (msg.type) {\n    case \"Patch\": {\n      // Mutate the todo state in place, and then send an update\n      if (todo !== undefined) {\n        let { newDocument: newTodo } = applyPatch(todo, msg.ops, false, false);\n\n        onTodoUpdate(newTodo);\n        todo = newTodo;\n      }\n      break;\n    }\n    case \"Full\": {\n      // Send on the full todo state\n      onTodoUpdate(msg.todo);\n      todo = msg.todo;\n      break;\n    }\n  }\n};\n\nNow, we're almost done with the websocket, we need to integrate it a tiny bit nicer with react and react hooks.\nFirstly, using the useEffect hook, we'll expose the todo state to a component which will rerender on object updates. You can provide a function starting with the keyword use to have it part of of the react render lifecycle.\nWe'll bind a call back to update a variable todo handled with useState when there are changes, and then return that variable state from the function to use in another component.\nexport const useWebsocket = () =&gt; {\n  // Keep our local state of the todo app to trigger a render on change\n  let [todo, updateTodo] = useState&lt;Todo&gt;();\n\n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\n    // Update our app state when changes are received\n    setupWebsocket((msg) =&gt; {\n      updateTodo(msg);\n    });\n    // If the destructor runs, clean up the websocket\n    return () =&gt; {\n      if (websocket) {\n        websocket.close(1000);\n      }\n    };\n    // The empty `[]` dependency list makes this `useEffect` callback execute only once on construction\n  }, []);\n\n  return todo;\n};\n\nAnother way of looking at it is this function is purely glue code to make it easy to integrate with react.\nLastly, we'll cheat again with our global variables and have a sendAction method which will, if the websocket is up and running, send a TodoAction to the backend:\nexport const sendAction = (action: TodoAction): void =&gt; {\n  if (websocket) {\n    websocket.send(JSON.stringify(action));\n  }\n};\n\nReact Components\nWe now have our general shape of our todo app, and have our websocket connection abstracted away nicely it's time to build up components.\nWe'll start with the main App component. This will be our root component, and will be responsible for building other components based upon the state. The App component is a perfect candidate to use our useWebsocket hook we have defined.\nWe'll add in a small \"loading\" indicator if the todo state is undefined, otherwise we'll pass on our todo state to a component:\nfunction App() {\n  const todo = useWebsocket();\n\n  return (\n    &lt;div className=\"container grid-lg\"&gt;\n      &lt;div className=\"columns\"&gt;\n        &lt;div className=\"column col-lg-12 todo-title\"&gt;\n          &lt;h1&gt;Todo App Example&lt;/h1&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n      {todo === undefined &amp;&amp; &lt;div className=\"loading loading-lg\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;}\n      {todo &amp;&amp; &lt;TodoComponent todo={todo} /&gt;}\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n}\n\nTodo Component\nOur TodoComponent is responsible for some of the more \"global\" actions of our state, such as adding a new todo, changing the todo list name and clearing out completed todos.\nLet's start with a standard functional component that takes a todo property as input:\nfunction TodoComponent({ todo }: { todo: Todo }) {\n  return &lt;&gt;&lt;/&gt;;\n}\n\nNow, let's build in the todo.name property. If we want users to be able to edit it, it should live in an input field:\n&lt;input value={todo.name} /&gt;\n\nThis will ensure the value is reflected, and since our todo object is \"hooked\" in to react, it will update when it changes.\nThe next step is to use an onChange callback to the input to send actions to the backed on change. We want to fire the ChangeName action, and so we can use the sendAction function from the websocket module to trigger this change.\n&lt;input\n  value={todo.name}\n  onChange={(ev) =&gt; {\n    sendAction({\n      type: \"ChangeName\",\n      name: ev.currentTarget.value,\n    });\n  }}\n/&gt;\n\nWith that in place, we have the bare minimum implemented to see state changes. Now would be a great time, if you have been following along, to fire up your IDE and see what happens when you type in that input field (make sure the backend is running!).\nNow, for each TodoRow we'll create a TodoRowComponent, which will be responsible for the state of that given row:\n{\n  Object.entries(todo.todos).map(([index, row]) =&gt; (\n    &lt;TodoRowComponent key={index} row={row} index={+index} /&gt;\n  ));\n}\n\nAnd underneath our the list, we will have two buttons.\nOne that only displays if there are todos that are completed:\nObject.entries(todo.todos).some(([, val]) =&gt; val.completed) &amp;&amp; (\n  &lt;button\n    className=\"btn\"\n    onClick={() =&gt; {\n      sendAction({\n        type: \"RemoveCompleted\",\n      });\n    }}\n  &gt;\n    Remove Completed\n  &lt;/button&gt;\n);\n\nAnd one that adds an extra item to the list:\n&lt;button\n  onClick={() =&gt; {\n    const entries = Object.entries(todo.todos);\n    sendAction({\n      type: \"Add\",\n      row: {\n        name: \"\",\n        completed: false,\n      },\n    });\n  }}\n&gt;\n  Add Todo\n&lt;/button&gt;\n\nTodoRowComponent\nThe TodoRowComponent will take a TodoRow and the index of that row, and display actions for the items in our todo list:\nfunction TodoRowComponent({ row, index }: { row: TodoRow; index: number }) {\n    ...\n}\n\nWe can add in a check box to mark things completed or not:\n&lt;input\n  type=\"checkbox\"\n  checked={row.completed}\n  onChange={() =&gt; {\n    sendAction({\n      type: \"Update\",\n      row: {\n        ...row,\n        completed: !row.completed,\n        index,\n      },\n    });\n  }}\n/&gt;\n\nAnd an input for the name of the specific todo list:\n&lt;input\n  value={row.name}\n  type=\"text\"\n  onChange={(ev) =&gt;\n    sendAction({\n      type: \"Update\",\n      row: {\n        ...row,\n        name: ev.currentTarget.value,\n        index,\n      },\n    })\n  }\n/&gt;\n\nAnd a button to remove that row:\n&lt;button\n  onClick={() =&gt;\n    sendAction({\n      type: \"Remove\",\n      index,\n    })\n  }\n/&gt;\n\nRunning and Debugging\nOk, we now have a frontend wired up to a backend, with a websocket used for state updates. Let's change a few values around and see what is going across the \"wire\".\nThe easiest way to do this, is via your browser's network tab, looking for the request to ws://localhost:3000/ws. In chrome, the tab you're looking for is Messages, and in firefox it's Response.\nYou can also use a tool like websocat to view the messages in a terminal.\nRunning this up, you'll see the initial message come through when subscribed:\n{ \"type\": \"Full\", \"todo\": { \"name\": \"\", \"todos\": [] } }\n\nThen, making changes you will see the updates feed in. For instance if you click the Add Todo button, you'll see an outbound action:\n{ \"type\": \"Add\", \"row\": { \"name\": \"\", \"completed\": false } }\n\nFollowed by a patch update from the server:\n{\n  \"type\": \"Patch\",\n  \"ops\": [\n    {\n      \"op\": \"add\",\n      \"path\": \"/todos/0\",\n      \"value\": { \"completed\": false, \"name\": \"\" }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nGo ahead and try out other updates to see what patches are generated and get a feel for the JSON patch format.\nConclusions\nStarting from the backend and then building out the frontend, we've used Websockets and JSON Patch to provide a platform of shared state updates.\nUsing existing standards and combining them together makes for a powerful and solid foundation. With rust, we get some great concurrency primitives that we can rely on to ensure our logic is correct.\nWe've demonstrated here that, we can provide a powerful framework, abstracting away our transport and state update logic, with room to grow.\nThe code for this article is available in a source repository here, so please feel free to tweak.\n","id":"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/synchronising-with-websocket/","title":"Synchronizing state with Websockets and JSON Patch"},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/tmq-0-1-0/":{"body":"TMQ is a rust library to use ZeroMQ within the Tokio ecosystem.  ZeroMQ is a distributed messaging queue written in C supporting a number of different messaging patterns.  While there are other options out there (including gRPC, etc..), I settled on ZeroMQ due to its cross-language support, great documentation and battle-tested nature.\nVersion 0.1.0 is an alpha release which implements request, response, publish and subscribe style sockets.\nUsage Example\nThis example uses tmq to subscribe to messages, and then prints them out via pretty-env-logger:\nextern crate failure;\nextern crate futures;\n#[macro_use]\nextern crate log;\nextern crate pretty_env_logger;\nextern crate tmq;\nextern crate tokio;\n\nuse futures::{Future, Stream};\nuse tmq::*;\nuse std::env;\n\nfn main() {\n    if let Err(_) = env::var(\"RUST_LOG\") {\n        env::set_var(\"RUST_LOG\", \"subscribe=DEBUG\");\n    }\n\n    pretty_env_logger::init();\n\n    let request = subscribe(&amp;Context::new())\n        .connect(\"tcp://127.0.0.1:7899\")\n        .expect(\"Couldn't connect\")\n        .subscribe(\"\")\n        .for_each(|val| {\n            info!(\"Subscribe: {}\", val.as_str().unwrap_or(\"\"));\n            Ok(())\n        })\n        .map_err(|e| {\n            error!(\"Error Subscribing: {}\", e);\n        });\n\n    tokio::run(request);\n}\n\nOther examples of usage can be found in the project itself: https://github.com/cetra3/tmq/tree/master/examples\nExisting Rust Crates\nTo find out where tmq sits within the rust ecosystem, it makes sense to discuss this in terms of other ZeroMQ crates.\nzmq - Rust ZeroMQ Bindings\nThis library has bindings to the C API and provides a great way to use ZeroMQ within rust.  You still need a copy of ZeroMQ on your system and need it compiled in, but that difficulty is pretty much on par with using OpenSSL.  I have managed to use this library in OSX, CentOS and Ubuntu with not many issues.\nThe only downside of this library is the lack of bindings to tokio, and is one of the primary motivators for creating tmq.\nzmq.rs - A Native Implementation of ZeroMQ in Rust\nThis library was a Rewrite in Rust attempt at a full ZeroMQ reimplementation, which hasn't seen any changes since 2015 and can probably be considered abandoned.  Regardless: this API is still the old blocking style, which would still predicate a need for tmq\nzmq-tokio - Run ØMQ sockets using tokio reactors, futures, etc.\nNot even published on crates.io but a great initial attempt at bridging the async gap.  This crate used the historic tokio-core library which is a bit of a pain to adapt to the new tokio crate.  Unfortunately it looks like it's since been abandoned.\ntokio-zmq - ZeroMQ Concepts with futures on Tokio's runtime\nThis library is probably the most polished version for tokio and one that would be compared mostly to tmq.\nI would have chosen this library, but the one major roadblock is the GPL license.  The GPL within a rust project is viral.  You can't use this library without making the rest of your project GPL or GPL Compatible. If this doesn't concern you, then I would consider using this library.\nComparison between tmq\nIn comparison to tokio-zmq, tmq has less boilerplate to acheive the same thing, but does use a couple of custom traits to speed things along.  This makes tmq a bit more opinionated, but less verbose.\nBoth styles have their merits, tokio-zmq does give you more control over things wheras tmq is, in my opinion, easier to write and reason about, but more restrictive in how you use it.\nTo do a direct comparison of both libraries we're using the response example.  This example is a simple echo response, which when it receives a message, it echos it back verbatim to the requester.\ntokio-zmq\nHere is the excerpt from tokio-zmq:\nlet ctx = Arc::new(zmq::Context::new());\nlet req_fut = Req::builder(ctx).connect(\"tcp://localhost:5560\").build();\n\nlet runner = req_fut.and_then(|req| {\n    req.send(build_multipart(0)).and_then(|req| {\n        let (sink, stream) = req.sink_stream(25).split();\n\n        stream\n            .zip(iter_ok(1..10_000))\n            .map(|(multipart, i)| {\n                for msg in multipart {\n                    if let Some(msg) = msg.as_str() {\n                        println!(\"Received: {}\", msg);\n                    }\n                }\n                build_multipart(i)\n            })\n            .forward(sink)\n    })\n});\n\nOn of the things you will notice is there is a lot of standard futures and tokio types used here: sink, stream, etc..  While this does make it more verbose, you are using constructs that you are familiar with in the futures style.\ntmq\nHere's a similar example (although not using multipart messages) from tmq:\nlet responder = respond(&amp;Context::new())\n    .bind(\"tcp://127.0.0.1:7899\")?\n    .with(|msg: Message| {\n        info!(\"Request: {}\", msg.as_str().unwrap_or(\"\"));\n        Ok(msg)\n    });\n\nYou'll notice that the library has a bit less boilerplate, but is more opinionated on how you structure a response.\nInstead of a sink/stream approach, the responder is a stream but has a with method.  The with method takes anything that implements the Responder trait, of which there is a blanket implemenation for closures and functions that take a message and return a message.\nFuture Changes\nWhile currently usable, the tmq library is far from finished and requires some work to bring it out of an alpha state.  In no particular order here are the plans for the library:\nTesting\nUnit tests and integration tests need to be added in order to confirm and wire up connections.  As the library is rather lightweight now the need for integration tests hasn't really arisen, but this will become more complicated in the future as more socket types are added.\nBenchmarking\nBenchmarks need to be added to the library in order to show the performance of using this over standard zmq.  Running up some dummy benchmarks show that it is perfomant enough for my current use case, and provides less overhead than your standard REST API calls.\nWindows Support\nI cheated a little by using the Evented trait for mio, which makes it dead easy to use in tokio via PollEvented2.\nUnfortunately the async story on windows is a bit different, and I haven't had a need to deploy on windows just yet.  But it is something that has been considered.\nDocumentation\nThe library is mostly undocumented besides from the examples.  Documentation should be pretty easy to do at this stage and won't take too long.\nMore Socket Types\nImplementing more socket types, to make this feature complete with the standard zmq library.  There a plethora of different socket types for different use cases that give different guarantees.  The 4 standard ones implemented are enough for me to start using this library today, but could easily be expanded.\nMultipart messages\nMultipart support for messages.  Currently this is not supported, but should be mostly easy to implement\nFurther thoughts\nI'm currently using tmq within an actix-web application to bridge some messages and audit logs between a polyglot backend (including Java &amp; Python).  It has been quite solid so far, and I have plans to remove an existing ActiveMQ service to be replaced with tmq where appropriate.\nVersion 0.1.0 is the first real release, with previous releases having to vendor in the zmq library in order to publish.   While it is alpha, I don't plan to change what is there currently unless there is a compelling reason to do so.\nPlease give tmq a try and let me know your thoughts!\n","id":"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/tmq-0-1-0/","title":"TMQ 0.1.0 Release: ZeroMQ bindings for Tokio"}},"docInfo":{"https://cetra3.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/breaking-api-changes/":{"body":638,"title":4},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/creating-your-own-derive-macro/":{"body":1057,"title":4},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/drawing-svg-graphs-rust/":{"body":1110,"title":4},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/face-detection-with-actix-web/":{"body":2289,"title":4},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/face-detection-with-tensorflow-rust/":{"body":1038,"title":4},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/implementing-a-jobq-sqlx/":{"body":677,"title":5},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/implementing-a-jobq-with-tokio/":{"body":1109,"title":5},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/implementing-a-jobq/":{"body":2220,"title":6},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/lorikeet-0-11-0/":{"body":388,"title":4},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/mpart-async-0-3-0/":{"body":874,"title":5},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/rust-2019/":{"body":486,"title":3},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/rust-2020/":{"body":535,"title":3},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/sharing-types-with-the-frontend/":{"body":1283,"title":5},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/synchronising-with-websocket/":{"body":2704,"title":5},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/tmq-0-1-0/":{"body":659,"title":6}},"length":17},"lang":"English"};
