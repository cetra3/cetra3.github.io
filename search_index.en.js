upgrading dependencies (basically deleting Cargo.lock) in a big rust project I hit an issue.  A new commit in serde_json caused has upstream failure in another library, jmespath, and possibly more crates. Because these structs and enums visibility has changed, this could be interpreted as a breaking change, depending on what you consider public.\nWhile jmespath was doing the wrong thing here, using undocumented API, it got me thinking about what can library maintainers and library consumers do to ensure semver compatibility, and what tools are out there to assist both groups.\nWhat is Semantic Versioning\nSemantic versioning (semver) is one standard used for version numbers which appears to have gained the most traction.   Since cargo and friends use semver to identify what versions to use, it is important to understand (excuse my pun) the semantics of what this means.\nThe full documentation of semver is on https://semver.org/, but for brevity there are 3 numbers:\n\nMajor: Any breaking API changes\nMinor: Additions of new features or functionality that are backwards compatible\nPatch: Bugfixes\n\nThere is some interesting differences for libraries &lt; 1.0.0 which I was not aware of for longer than I care to admit.  Namely either minor or patch numbers can be changes as you see fit.  I.e, 0.3.0 could be wildly different from 0.3.1, including breaking changes.\nHowever: Cargo is more strict than the semver documentation for &lt; 1.0.0 libraries:\n\nThis compatibility convention is different from SemVer in the way it treats versions before 1.0.0. While SemVer says there is no compatibility before 1.0.0, Cargo considers 0.x.y to be compatible with 0.x.z, where y ≥ z and x &gt; 0.\n\nWhy we need it\nWe need some way of portraying changes to an API and, while it's not perfect, it appears to be a defacto standard which makes interoperability with other libraries and crates a lot easier.\nIt also gives cargo a programmatic way of finding updated versions, when it's used appropriately.\nSo it is one part advertising the intent of the version and another part ensuring that things will compile if you bump up certain numbers.\nAPI Evolution RFC\nThe Semver website is very general in its language and isn't specific to rust.  There is, however, a great RFC that has some excellent guidelines both for the language itself &amp; for library maintainers: RFC 1105: API Evolution\nHere are a couple of excerpts:\n\nMajor change: going from stable to nightly\nChanging a crate from working on stable Rust to requiring a nightly is\nconsidered a breaking change. That includes using #[feature] directly, or\nusing a dependency that does so. Crate authors should consider using Cargo\n\"features\" for\ntheir crate to make such use opt-in.\n\n\nMajor change: renaming/moving/removing any public items.\nAlthough renaming an item might seem like a minor change, according to the\ngeneral policy design this is not a permitted form of breakage: it's not\npossible to annotate code in advance to avoid the breakage, nor is it possible\nto prevent the breakage from affecting dependencies.\n\nThis RFC has some great advice, and I wish it was more publicly known, but seems relatively obscure.\nThe Non-Exhaustive Attribute\nAnother RFC related to versioning is Non-Exhaustive, which is a handy way of planning breaking changes ahead of time.  It works with enums by forcing open ended match statements, which means consumers of your enum won't break if a new variant is introducted. It also works with structs and ensures users consuming libraries can't create them.\nThis was recently stabilised in Rust 1.40 so it's a rather new feature of the language (on a side note: it's not easy to find when a particular RFC is stabilised, it would be great to have this reflected in the RFC somewhere).\nAs an example if you have an enum like this:\n#[non_exhaustive]\npub enum Error {\n    Message(String),\n    Other,\n}\n\nYou would need to match against the enum like this:\nmatch error {\n    Message(ref s) =&gt; ...,\n    Other =&gt; ...,\n    _ =&gt; ...,\n}\n\nYour library could then introduce a new variant, which wouldn't break the existing consumer:\n#[non_exhaustive]\npub enum Error {\n    Message(String),\n    IOError,\n    Other,\n}\nOther Tools\nThere have been some tools to both manage breaking changes in the past, a lot of the things I found were unmaintained or not in active use.  There might also be some great language features that I haven't discovered yet that crate authors are already using.\nThe Semver Trick\nDocumented here is the semver trick, which touts to be able to assist in this with downstream dependencies.\nThere is mention of a libcpocalypse, which does not sound nice and may happen again if there is a major version increase to libc.  I tried to find some information about where this had happened before but searching for the term circles back to this project and doesn't give a great overview of the pains users had to go through before.\nRust Semverver\nrust-semverver is a Google Summer of Code Project which checks semver compliance with rust crates by using a novel approach:\n\nThe approach taken is to compile both versions of the crate to rlibs and to link them as dependencies of a third, empty, dummy crate. Then, a custom compiler driver is run on the said dummy and all necessary analysis is performed in that context, where type information and other resources are available.\n\nSemantic-RS\nAn existing tool called semantic-rs touts to be able to do this for your crates automatically.  This doesn't appear to have any changes for over a year, but does have an active issue register, but no PRs have been accepted for a while.  It is highly opinionated as well, and may not be appropriate to bolt on to an existing library.  This looks like something you need to use from the beginning as well.\nRust Breaking Changes\nThis also doesn't appear to be maintained, but was an automatic listing of breaking changes to rust: https://killercup.github.io/bitrust/.   I do wonder though how many of those changes are internal, as I don't believe there have been many external breaking changes.\nFuture Proofing\nThere is a chapter of the Rust API Guidelines which deals with how to future proof an API, but as with other tools I have found does not appear to be updated in quite a while:\nFuture Proofing: https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/future-proofing.html\nConclusion\nWhile there has been a historic push to get crates to 1.0.0, There does not appear to be much in the way of modern tooling in order to help with this and the focus of previous efforts see them moving elsewhere.\nWith more libraries reaching 1.0.0 I think it's important to introduce more safety nets for library authors and consumers.  As an idea, we can potentially see whether a crate has breaking change through lints etc.. so why don't we do that when we publish to crates.io?\nThere is a lot of room for improvement here, and as new users come on board and new companies look at adopting, it's important that the stability of semver is maintained.  I still think the way that cargo handles this is much better than other ecosystems.\n","id":"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/breaking-api-changes/","title":"Handling Breaking API Changes"},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/face-detection-with-actix-web/":{"body":"Last article I wrote about how to use tensorflow with rust.  This time we're going to take what we've built on, and serve it as an HTTP API call.  As Actix Web is nearing its inevitable 1.0 release, I thought it would be a great time to build something with it.\nThis article assumes you have some knowledge about Futures and how they work. I will do my best to explain in simpler terms, but understanding the futures ecosystem would be quite handy to help work through this article. For this, I suggest you start with tokio.\n(Some people have suggested waiting for async/await and friends to land before diving into Futures.  I think you should get your hands dirty now: async programming will always be challenging and the changes being introduced only affect ergonomics, not fundamentals)\nOnce again for the impatient, you can find the reference code here on the actix-web branch: \nhttps://github.com/cetra3/mtcnn/tree/actix-web\nAPI Shape\nThe API shape here is rather simple.  We want to emulate what we've done on the command line: Submit a picture, have a picture returned.  To make things interesting, we'll provide a way to return the bounding boxes as a JSON array too.\nFor submitting binary data via HTTP, there are a few options off the top of my head:\n\nSimply submit the raw data as it stands\nUse multipart/form-data\nEncode it as a JSON submission\n\nI think the easiest would be just the raw data so let's do that!  Multipart could possibly also work, but what about the case when you have to handle multiple images?  JSON Submission seems a bit wasteful, as you would inevitably have to convert binary data using base64 or similar.\nSo our API looks like this:\n\nSubmit POST request as a raw file submission\nRun a session against mtcnn to extract faces\nEither return Bounding Boxes as JSON, or an Image Overlay as a JPEG like the command line example\n\nMTCNN as a struct\nIn our last blog we just simply used the main function to perform everything, but it's not going to fly with actix until we do a bit of a refactor.  We want to encapsulate the mtcnn behaviour as a struct, something that can be passed around and moved.  The end goal is to use it in the application state.\nStruct Shape\nLet's make our struct include everything we need:\n\nThe Graph\nThe Session\nSome of the Tensor input params that don't change from request to request.\n\nWe'll start by creating a new file mtcnn.rs and adding in the struct definition.\nuse tensorflow::{Graph, Session, Tensor};\n\npub struct Mtcnn {\n    graph: Graph,\n    session: Session,\n    min_size: Tensor&lt;f32&gt;,\n    thresholds: Tensor&lt;f32&gt;,\n    factor: Tensor&lt;f32&gt;\n}\n\nOk, now we're just going to plop in the initiation stuff in a new() method.  As the creation of some of these values is not infallible, we'll return a Result:\npub fn new() -&gt; Result&lt;Self, Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;&gt; {\n\n    let model = include_bytes!(\"mtcnn.pb\");\n\n    let mut graph = Graph::new();\n    graph.import_graph_def(&amp;*model, &amp;ImportGraphDefOptions::new())?;\n\n    let session = Session::new(&amp;SessionOptions::new(), &amp;graph)?;\n\n    let min_size = Tensor::new(&amp;[]).with_values(&amp;[40f32])?;\n    let thresholds = Tensor::new(&amp;[3]).with_values(&amp;[0.6f32, 0.7f32, 0.7f32])?;\n    let factor = Tensor::new(&amp;[]).with_values(&amp;[0.709f32])?;\n\n    Ok(Self {\n        graph,\n        session,\n        min_size,\n        thresholds,\n        factor\n    })\n\n}\nThe Run Function\n(I'm going to race along here to get to the good parts, so if you get stuck or are unsure about what's going on, have a look at the original article for an explanation of what's happening here.)\nWe've added all the bits we need to run our session Let's create a method that does what we're asking the API to do: submit an image, return some bounding boxes:\npub fn run(&amp;self, img: &amp;DynamicImage) -&gt; Result&lt;Vec&lt;BBoxes&gt;, Status&gt; {\n    ...\n}\n\nOnce again, we are returning a Result as the type, as there are some parts of the run that can fail.  We're going to use the Status type as that is normally the error type returned\nLike our previous main function, we'll need to flatten the image input:\nlet input = {\n    let mut flattened: Vec&lt;f32&gt; = Vec::new();\n\n    for (_x, _y, rgb) in img.pixels() {\n        flattened.push(rgb[2] as f32);\n        flattened.push(rgb[1] as f32);\n        flattened.push(rgb[0] as f32);\n    }\n\n    Tensor::new(&amp;[img.height() as u64, img.width() as u64, 3])\n        .with_values(&amp;flattened)?\n};\n\nThen we'll feed in all the relevant inputs.  This is just the same as our previous main function, but we're going to just borrow values from self rather than create them for each run:\nlet mut args = SessionRunArgs::new();\n\nargs.add_feed(\n    &amp;self.graph.operation_by_name_required(\"min_size\")?,\n    0,\n    &amp;self.min_size,\n);\nargs.add_feed(\n    &amp;self.graph.operation_by_name_required(\"thresholds\")?,\n    0,\n    &amp;self.thresholds,\n);\nargs.add_feed(\n    &amp;self.graph.operation_by_name_required(\"factor\")?,\n    0,\n    &amp;self.factor,\n);\nargs.add_feed(&amp;self.graph.operation_by_name_required(\"input\")?, 0, &amp;input);\n\nNext, let's grab the outputs we want:\nlet bbox = args.request_fetch(&amp;self.graph.operation_by_name_required(\"box\")?, 0);\nlet prob = args.request_fetch(&amp;self.graph.operation_by_name_required(\"prob\")?, 0);\nRunning The Session\nNow we have all our args set up, we can run the session:\n&amp;self.session.run(&amp;mut args)?;\n\nUh oh.  We're getting a compiler error here... \nerror[E0596]: cannot borrow `self.session` as mutable, as it is behind a `&amp;` reference\n  --&gt; src/mtcnn.rs:68:10\n   |\n36 |     pub fn run(&amp;self, img: &amp;DynamicImage) -&gt; Result&lt;DynamicImage, Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;&gt; {\n   |                ----- help: consider changing this to be a mutable reference: `&amp;mut self`\n...\n68 |         &amp;self.session.run(&amp;mut args)?;\n   |          ^^^^^^^^^^^^ `self` is a `&amp;` reference, so the data it refers to cannot be borrowed as mutable\n\nTurns out that the Session::run() function takes &amp;mut self.\nWhat can we do to resolve this:\n\nMake our run function take &amp;mut self so we can mutate the field\nDo some tricky interior mutability\nSubmit an issue on the tensorflow-rust crate to see whether Session really needs to take &amp;mut self.\n\nWe'll go with option 3!\nUpdate your Cargo.toml to point to the git master, rather than the cargo version:\ntensorflow = { git = \"https://github.com/tensorflow/rust\"}\nGetting the Bounding Boxes\nThis has not changed at all since our main method.  We grab the bounding boxes, put them in our handy dandy BBox struct:\n//Our bounding box extents\nlet bbox_res: Tensor&lt;f32&gt; = args.fetch(bbox)?;\n//Our facial probability\nlet prob_res: Tensor&lt;f32&gt; = args.fetch(prob)?;\n\n//Let's store the results as a Vec&lt;BBox&gt;\nlet mut bboxes = Vec::new();\n\nlet mut i = 0;\nlet mut j = 0;\n\n//While we have responses, iterate through\nwhile i &lt; bbox_res.len() {\n    //Add in the 4 floats from the `bbox_res` array.\n    //Notice the y1, x1, etc.. is ordered differently to our struct definition.\n    bboxes.push(BBox {\n        y1: bbox_res[i],\n        x1: bbox_res[i + 1],\n        y2: bbox_res[i + 2],\n        x2: bbox_res[i + 3],\n        prob: prob_res[j], // Add in the facial probability\n    });\n\n    //Step `i` ahead by 4.\n    i += 4;\n    //Step `i` ahead by 1.\n    j += 1;\n}\n\ndebug!(\"BBox Length: {}, BBoxes:{:#?}\", bboxes.len(), bboxes);\n\nOk(bboxes)\n\nAnd that's our run function finished.\nBBox Struct as JSON\nWe're gonna want to return a JSON representation of the BBox struct.  So let's add in serde_derive:\nuse serde_derive::Serialize;\n\n#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, Serialize)]\npub struct BBox {\n    pub x1: f32,\n    pub y1: f32,\n    pub x2: f32,\n    pub y2: f32,\n    pub prob: f32,\n}\nDrawing the Output Image\nWe'll create a function that will take a list of bounding boxes and an input image, returning the output image:\npub fn overlay(img: &amp;DynamicImage, bboxes: &amp;Vec&lt;BBox&gt;) -&gt; DynamicImage\n\nThis hasn't changed much either, but we are returning the image, rather than saving it to a file:\n//Let's clone the input image\nlet mut output_image = img.clone();\n\n//Iterate through all bounding boxes\nfor bbox in bboxes {\n    //Create a `Rect` from the bounding box.\n    let rect = Rect::at(bbox.x1 as i32, bbox.y1 as i32)\n        .of_size((bbox.x2 - bbox.x1) as u32, (bbox.y2 - bbox.y1) as u32);\n\n    //Draw a green line around the bounding box\n    draw_hollow_rect_mut(&amp;mut output_image, rect, LINE_COLOUR);\n}\n\noutput_image\n\nOk, we're pretty much done with our Mtcnn struct and functions! Could we break this down even further? Yeah definitely! But for now, I think this is all we need.  We've encapsulated the behaviour and created a nice to use couple of functions.\nOur New Main Function\nOk, so we're no longer using it as a CLI, but as a self-hosted web app.  We're going to need to change the arguments our application takes since we no longer have input and output files.\nI think the only argument we should be taking initially is the listen address, and even then we should use a sensible default. So let's use the help of structopt to make this pretty minimal boilerplate:\n#[derive(StructOpt)]\nstruct Opt {\n    #[structopt(\n        short = \"l\",\n        long = \"listen\",\n        help = \"Listen Address\",\n        default_value = \"127.0.0.1:8000\"\n    )]\n    listen: String,\n}\nLogging Framework\nActix Web uses the log crate to display errors and debug messages.\nLet's move on from using println! and instead use log.  I like using pretty_env_logger as it prints different levels as a different colour, and we can have timestamps which is useful.\npretty_env_logger still uses environment vars.  Let's cheat and set our RUST_LOG var if none is provided then initiate our logger\n//Set the `RUST_LOG` var if none is provided\nif env::var(\"RUST_LOG\").is_err() {\n    env::set_var(\"RUST_LOG\", \"mtcnn=DEBUG,actix_web=DEBUG\");\n}\n\n//Create a timestamped logger\npretty_env_logger::init_timed();\n\nThis sets up DEBUG level logs for our app and actix web, but allows us to change the log levels via environment variables still.\nActix and State\nWe have some state we need to pass to actix to use: our Mtcnn struct and the run method.  There are a number of ways you can give State to actix, but probably the easiest way is the App::data method.  As we are now entering a multithreaded world, we're going to have to think about what things are Send and Sync.\nOk, so how do we share something between threads? Well, as a first step I would look to std::sync to see what we need.  Since we know that mtcnn's run function does not need to mutate it, only requiring a reference to immutable self, we can probably wrap it in an Arc.  If we had to mutate it, then it would probably require a Mutex as well, but we can avoid this if we use the master branch of tensorflow-rust as above.\nSo let's create our Arc:\nlet mtcnn = Arc::new(Mtcnn::new()?);\n\nNow, to instantiate the server:\nHttpServer::new(move || {\n    App::new()\n        //Add in our mtcnn struct, we clone the reference for each worker thread\n        .data(mtcnn.clone())\n        //Add in a logger to see the requests coming through\n        .wrap(middleware::Logger::default())\n        // Add in some routes here\n        .service(\n            ...\n        )\n})\n.bind(&amp;opt.listen)? // Use the listener from the command arguments\n.run()\n\nOk, let's step through what we're doing:\n\nWe first build a HttpServer\nThis takes a closure which should return an App.  This App is instantiated for each thread the http server is running\nWe add our Arc&lt;Mtcnn&gt; using the data method, and clone it for each thread listener.\nWe add a logger middleware.\nWe set up some routes with the service function\nThen we bind to a listen address and run\n\nHandling a Request\nActix Web is an Async framework and uses tokio.  Our function is Synchronous and takes some time to complete.\nIn other words, our request is blocking.  Can we mix and match sync and async? Absolutely, but it is a little more cumbersome as you'll see.\nFunction Signature and Extractors\nActix 1.0 makes heavy use of Extractors, which is a way of providing functions of quite different shapes.  You basically specify what you want your web function to receive, and actix will wire it up for you.  Take care though:  This does mean that some things won't be discovered wrong until runtime.  A perfect example I had when I used the wrong type signature for the web::Data argument.\nSo what do we need to extract from our request? The bytes of the request body, and and also our mtcnn:\nfn handle_request(\n    stream: web::Payload,\n    mtcnn: web::Data&lt;Arc&lt;Mtcnn&gt;&gt;,\n) -&gt; impl Future&lt;Item = HttpResponse, Error = ActixError&gt; {\n\n    ...\n\n}\n\nWe will use this type signature for mtcnn a fair bit, so let's make a type alias for it:\ntype WebMtcnn = web::Data&lt;Arc&lt;Mtcnn&gt;&gt;;\nGetting the Image from a Payload\nOk, so we need a way of retrieving the image from a payload and returning a Future.  The web::Payload struct implements Stream with Item set to Bytes.\nWell, we don't really care about the individual bytes we get from a stream, we want the whole lot to decode the image!  So let's convert the Stream into a Future, and merge all the individual bytes we'll be getting into one big bucket of bytes.  Sounds complicated, but luckily Stream has a method: concat2. \nThis is a pretty powerful combinator which allows us to join the results of individual Stream polls into one if the item implements Extend (and some other traits) which Bytes happens to.\nSo this looks like:\nstream.concat2().and_then(....)\nImage Decoding and web::block\nOk, second thing we need to sort out, if we're going to be decoding an image, that is probably going to block the thread until it's done.  How long? Well if it's a huge image, it might take milliseconds!  So we want to ensure that we're not blocking the http workers while this is happening.  Luckily, actix web has a way of taking a blocking portion of code, and wrapping that as a future.\nEnter web::block.  We'll do our decoding in a cpu pool, bridging sync and async together:\nstream.concat2().and_then(move |bytes| {\n    web::block(move || {\n        image::load_from_memory(&amp;bytes)\n    })\n})\n\nOk, that is pretty succint: we take a stream, convert it into a future and a bundle of bytes, then use web::block to decode the bytes into an image in a background thread and return the result.  the load_from_memory function already returns a Result, which means we can just use that as the return type.\nBalancing the Error Type\nSo, our Item is converted to Bytes to DynamicImage, but we still haven't dealt with the error types yet and it won't compile.  What should our error type be?  Let's use actix_web::Error as ActixError:\nuse actix_web::{Error as ActixError}\n\nfn get_image(stream: web::Payload) -&gt; impl Future&lt;Item = DynamicImage, Error = ActixError&gt; {\n    stream.concat2().and_then(move |bytes| {\n        web::block(move || {\n            image::load_from_memory(&amp;bytes)\n        })\n    })\n}\n\nOk, that is giving us few really gnarly errors when we try and compile it:\nerror[E0271]: type mismatch resolving `&lt;impl futures::future::Future as futures::future::IntoFuture&gt;::Error == actix_http::error::PayloadError`\n  --&gt; src/main.rs:67:22\n   |\n67 |     stream.concat2().and_then(move |bytes| {\n   |                      ^^^^^^^^ expected enum `actix_threadpool::BlockingError`, found enum `actix_http::error::PayloadError`\n   |\n   = note: expected type `actix_threadpool::BlockingError&lt;image::image::ImageError&gt;`\n              found type `actix_http::error::PayloadError`\n\nThere's a couple more that aren't listed.\nWhen you are combining streams, mapping them as futures, and otherwise trying to get some output from these combinators you are actually dealing with both the Item type, and the Error type.\nThe ergonomics of this are not as advanced as the Result type, where we can use the ? operator to automatically adjust to the right error (if a conversion is available). When both ops::Try and async/await syntax stabilises, this might be a different story, but for now, we need to deal with error types.\nWhat we have instead is the magic™️ from_err() method.  This is basically the same as the ? operator but for futures.  We have two futures we're dealing with: our bundle of bytes from the stream, and the image from the blocking closure. We have 3 error types we're dealing with: the Payload error, the Image load from memory error, and the blocking error.\nLet's start by putting from_err() on both of the futures:\nfn get_image(stream: web::Payload)\n  -&gt; impl Future&lt;Item = DynamicImage, Error = ActixError&gt; {\n    stream.concat2().from_err().and_then(move |bytes| {\n        web::block(move || {\n            image::load_from_memory(&amp;bytes)\n        }).from_err()\n    })\n}\n\nThat worked! There is enough conversions for our error types to get to where we need to get it.  The ActixError type has a few blanket conversions from common error types enough to be able to make this magic happen.\nGetting the bounding boxes from the image\nAt the core of it, we need to run the following:\nmtcnn.run(&amp;img)\n\nBut we want this to run in a threadpool too:\nweb::block(|| mtcnn.run(&amp;img))\n\nLet's work through the function signature we'll need.  At a minimum we're gonna need the image, and the mtcnn struct.  Then we want to return a Vec of BBoxes.  We should try and keep our error types the same, so we'll use the ActixError type.\nThe function signature looks like this:\nfn get_bboxes(img: DynamicImage, mtcnn: WebMtcnn) \n  -&gt; impl Future&lt;Item = Vec&lt;BBox&gt;, Error = ActixError&gt; \n\nWe know that we'll need a from_err() on the web::block to convert the error type, and we'll have to use a move to give the image to the closure:\nfn get_bboxes(img: DynamicImage, mtcnn: WebMtcnn) -&gt; impl Future&lt;Item = Vec&lt;BBox&gt;, Error = ActixError&gt; {\n    web::block(move || mtcnn.run(&amp;img)).from_err()\n}\n\nBut does this compile? Not yet:\nerror[E0277]: `*mut tensorflow_sys::TF_Status` cannot be sent between threads safely\n  --&gt; src/main.rs:75:5\n   |\n75 |     web::block(move || mtcnn.run(&amp;img)).from_err()\n   |     ^^^^^^^^^^ `*mut tensorflow_sys::TF_Status` cannot be sent between threads safely\n   |\n   = help: within `tensorflow::Status`, the trait `std::marker::Send` is not implemented for `*mut tensorflow_sys::TF_Status`\n   = note: required because it appears within the type `tensorflow::Status`\n   = note: required by `actix_web::web::block`\n\ntensorflow::Status, which is the error type, can't be sent between threads.\nLet's just shortcut here, and convert the error to a String:\nfn get_bboxes(img: DynamicImage, mtcnn: WebMtcnn) -&gt; impl Future&lt;Item = Vec&lt;BBox&gt;, Error = ActixError&gt; {\n    web::block(move || mtcnn.run(&amp;img).map_err(|e| e.to_string())).from_err()\n}\n\nThis allows us to move the Result across thread boundaries, as String does implement Send\nReturning JSON BBoxes\nOk, so we have 2 functions, one to get the image from the request, and one to get the bounding boxes.  We're gonna want to return json HttpResponse:\nfn return_bboxes(\n    stream: web::Payload,\n    mtcnn: WebMtcnn,\n) -&gt; impl Future&lt;Item = HttpResponse, Error = ActixError&gt; {\n    // Get the image from the input stream\n    get_image(stream) \n        // Get the bounding boxes from the image\n        .and_then(move |img| get_bboxes(img, mtcnn)) \n        // Map the bounding boxes to a json HttpResponse\n        .map(|bboxes| HttpResponse::Ok().json(bboxes))\n}\n\nCool! Let's put this in our App definition:\nHttpServer::new(move || {\n    App::new()\n        .data(mtcnn.clone()) \n        .wrap(middleware::Logger::default()) \n        // our new API service\n        .service(web::resource(\"/api/v1/bboxes\").to_async(return_bboxes))\n})\n.bind(&amp;opt.listen)?\n.run()\n\nAnd let's run it, using curl to submit a query to get some results back\n$ curl --data-binary @rustfest.jpg  http://localhost:8000/api/v1/bboxes\n\n[{\"x1\":471.4591,\"y1\":287.59888,\"x2\":495.3053,\"y2\":317.25327,\"prob\":0.9999908}....\n\nAwesome! Using jmespath to see we get our 120 faces back:\n$ curl -s --data-binary @rustfest.jpg  http://localhost:8000/api/v1/bboxes | jp \"length(@)\"\n120\nReturning an Overlay Image\nThe other API call we want is to return an image with the bounding boxes overlayed.  This is not much of a stretch, but the act of drawing boxes on an image is definitely a blocking action, so we'll need to do the same thing and send it to a thread pool.\nLet's wrap our overlay function, converting it into a Future:\nfn get_overlay(img: DynamicImage, bboxes: Vec&lt;BBox&gt;)\n   -&gt; impl Future&lt;Item = Vec&lt;u8&gt;, Error = ActixError&gt; {\n    web::block(move || {\n        let output_img = overlay(&amp;img, &amp;bboxes);\n        \n        ...\n\n    }).from_err()\n}\n\nWe're going to want to return a Vec of u8 bytes so we can use this in the return body. So we'll need to allocate some buffer and instruct image to write out a JPEG from the image:\nlet mut buffer = vec![];\n\noutput_img.write_to(&amp;mut buffer, JPEG)?; // write out our buffer\n\nOk(buffer)\n\nOk, so let's put our little function together and see if it compiles:\nfn get_overlay(img: DynamicImage, bboxes: Vec&lt;BBox&gt;)\n  -&gt; impl Future&lt;Item = Vec&lt;u8&gt;, Error = ActixError&gt; {\n    web::block(move || {\n        let output_img = overlay(&amp;img, &amp;bboxes);\n\n        let mut buffer = Vec::new();\n\n        output_img.write_to(&amp;mut buffer, JPEG)?; // write out our buffer\n\n        Ok(buffer)\n    }).from_err()\n}\n\nNot quite yet: we're missing a type annotation:\nerror[E0282]: type annotations needed\n  --&gt; src/main.rs:82:5\n   |\n82 |     web::block(move || {\n   |     ^^^^^^^^^^ cannot infer type for `E`\n\nWhy is there an issue with the type? Well, it relates to this line here:\nOk(buffer) // What's the `Error` type here?\n\nAt the moment, the only error type is from the write_to method which is ImageError.  But this line here doesn't have an error type, and could be anything.\nThere are 3 ways I can immediately think to handle this:\nWay Number 1: Declare the error type in web::block\nweb::block::&lt;_,_,ImageError&gt;\n\nThis looks more like a turbosubmarine than a turbofish! But it compiles!\nWay Number 2: Declare the Result type with as \nOk(buffer) as Result&lt;_, ImageError&gt;\n\nWay Number 3: Use map to return the buffer on success:\noutput_img.write_to(&amp;mut buffer, JPEG).map(|_| buffer)\n\nI think for readability, #2 is probably easiest.  The web::block function takes 3 type arguments which can be confusing on first read of the code.  #3 is good too but I think it looks a bit strange.\nOur final method looks like:\nfn get_overlay(img: DynamicImage, bboxes: Vec&lt;BBox&gt;)\n   -&gt; impl Future&lt;Item = Vec&lt;u8&gt;, Error = ActixError&gt; {\n    web::block(move || {\n        let output_img = overlay(&amp;img, &amp;bboxes);\n\n        let mut buffer = Vec::new();\n\n        output_img.write_to(&amp;mut buffer, JPEG)?;\n\n        // Type annotations required for the `web::block`\n        Ok(buffer) as Result&lt;_, ImageError&gt; \n    }).from_err()\n}\nThe API call\nOk, we have our little futures that we need to return bounding boxes and image overlays.  Let's stitch this together and return a HttpResponse:\nfn return_overlay(\n    stream: web::Payload,\n    mtcnn: WebMtcnn,\n) -&gt; impl Future&lt;Item = HttpResponse, Error = ActixError&gt; {\n    //... magic happens here\n}\n\nOk, first step is to get the image from the stream:\nget_image(stream)\n\nAnd Then once the future has resolved, we want to get the bounding boxes:\nget_image(stream).and_then(move |img| {\n    get_bboxes(img, mtcnn)\n})\nMoving Images Around\nNow we want to get the image overlay.  We have an issue though! we give the get_bboxes future our image, and it returns a Vec of bboxes, consuming the image.  There are a couple of options here.  We could clone() the image when we give it to bboxes, but that is duplicating memory.  We could wait for Pin and async/await to be finished and probably deal with it in an easier way then.\nOr we could adjust our get_bboxes method to return a tuple of both the image and bounding boxes:\nfn get_bboxes(\n    img: DynamicImage,\n    mtcnn: WebMtcnn,\n) -&gt; impl Future&lt;Item = (DynamicImage, Vec&lt;BBox&gt;), Error = ActixError&gt; {\n    web::block(move || {\n        mtcnn\n            .run(&amp;img)\n            .map_err(|e| e.to_string())\n            //Return both the image and the bounding boxes\n            .map(|bboxes| (img, bboxes))\n    })\n    .from_err()\n}\n\nMaking sure to update our return_bboxes function too:\nfn return_bboxes(\n    stream: web::Payload,\n    mtcnn: WebMtcnn,\n) -&gt; impl Future&lt;Item = HttpResponse, Error = ActixError&gt; {\n    get_image(stream)\n        .and_then(move |img| get_bboxes(img, mtcnn))\n        .map(|(_img, bboxes)| HttpResponse::Ok().json(bboxes))\n}\nGetting the Overlay\nIt would be great if rust could desugar a tuple into command arguments.  Unfortunately not for us, so we will need to create a small closure:\n//Create our image overlay\n.and_then(|(img, bbox)| get_overlay(img, bbox))\n.map(|buffer| {\n// Return a `HttpResponse` here\n})\nGenerating the Response\nOur HttpResponse needs to wrap the buffer into a Http Request with the buffer as the body:\nHttpResponse::with_body(StatusCode::OK, buffer.into())\n\nIs that it? Well no, we have to set the content type header to be a jpeg:\nlet mut response = HttpResponse::with_body(StatusCode::OK, buffer.into());\n\nresponse\n    .headers_mut()\n    .insert(CONTENT_TYPE, HeaderValue::from_static(\"image/jpeg\"));\n\nOk now we can return the result:\nfn return_overlay(\n    stream: web::Payload,\n    mtcnn: WebMtcnn,\n) -&gt; impl Future&lt;Item = HttpResponse, Error = ActixError&gt; {\n    get_image(stream)\n        .and_then(move |img| {\n            get_bboxes(img, mtcnn)\n        })\n        .and_then(|(img, bbox) | get_overlay(img, bbox))\n        .map(|buffer| {\n            let mut response = HttpResponse::with_body(StatusCode::OK, buffer.into());\n            response\n                .headers_mut()\n                .insert(CONTENT_TYPE, HeaderValue::from_static(\"image/jpeg\"));\n            response\n        })\n}\n\nAnd add that to our App builder:\nHttpServer::new(move || {\n    App::new()\n        .data(mtcnn.clone()) //Add in our data handler\n        //Add in a logger to see the requets coming through\n        .wrap(middleware::Logger::default()) \n        //JSON bounding boxes\n        .service(web::resource(\"/api/v1/bboxes\").to_async(return_bboxes))\n        //Image overlay\n        .service(web::resource(\"/api/v1/overlay\").to_async(return_overlay))\n}\n\nGreat! Let's run it:\n$ curl --data-binary @rustfest.jpg  http://localhost:8000/api/v1/bboxes &gt; output.jpg\n\nAnd we have our original overlay!\n\nConclusions\nWe stepped through converting a CLI app into a HTTP service, dipping our toes into the brave new async world.\nAs you can see, actix web is a very versatile web framework.  My interest in it was borne out of having all the features I need to build up web apps: multipart, thread pools, great efficiency.\nWhile it is hard to bridge the sync and async gap, it's not impossible.  It would be great if there were some more ergonomic ways to do so, as I think a lot of developers struggle with this: I have seen a lot of questions around integrating with diesel and friends.\nIf you are looking for more actix web examples, the evergrowing examples repo is your best bet:\nhttps://github.com/actix/examples\nI look forward to seeing what the community builds in the future!\n","id":"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/face-detection-with-actix-web/","title":"Face Detection with Actix Web"},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/face-detection-with-tensorflow-rust/":{"body":"One of the promises of machine learning is to be able to use it for object recognition in photos.  This includes being able to pick out features such as animals, buildings and even faces.\nThis article will step you through using some existing models to accomplish face detection using rust and tensorflow.  For the impatient among you, you can find the source code here: https://github.com/cetra3/mtcnn\nWe will be using a pre-trained model called mtcnn for face detection (Note: training a new model is not something we'll be concerned with in this article).\nThe Challenge\nWe want to read the photo, have the faces detected, and then return an image with the bounding boxes drawn in.\nIn other words, we want to convert this (Image used with permission of RustFest, taken by Fiona Castiñeira):\n\nInto this:\n\nTensorflow and MTCNN\nThe original MTCNN model was written using Caffe, but luckily there is a number of tensorflow python implementations for mtcnn.  I'm going to pick the following as it is a straight conversion into a single graph model file.\nFirstly we want to add tensorflow rust as a dependency.  Here's a Cargo.toml to start:\n[package]\nname = \"mtcnn\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nedition = \"2018\"\n\n[dependencies]\ntensorflow = \"0.12.0\"\n\nWhat we're going to do is load a Graph which is the pre-trained MTCNN, and run a session.  The gist is that a Graph is the model used for computation, and a Session is one run of the Graph.  A lot more information about these concepts can be found here.  I like to think of the Graph as an artificial brain in a vat, just to get some great imagery when you start plugging in inputs and outputs.\nSo let's start by grabbing the existing mtcnn.pb model and trying to load it up.  Tensorflow graphs are serialised out in protobuf format and can be loaded in using Graph::import_graph_def.\nuse std::error::Error;\n\nuse tensorflow::Graph;\nuse tensorflow::ImportGraphDefOptions;\n\nfn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;&gt; {\n\n    //First, we load up the graph as a byte array\n    let model = include_bytes!(\"mtcnn.pb\");\n\n    //Then we create a tensorflow graph from the model\n    let mut graph = Graph::new();\n    graph.import_graph_def(&amp;*model, &amp;ImportGraphDefOptions::new())?\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n\nRunning cargo run we should see no errors:\n$ cargo run\n   Compiling mtcnn v0.1.0 (~/mtcnn)\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.89s\n     Running `target/debug/mtcnn`\n\nGreat! Looks like we can load the graph!\nStructOpt and the Command Line\nWe're going to want to test out image generation, so let's use structopt to take two arguments: input and output.\nIf you haven't used structopt before: structopt is like combining clap with serde.  The input argument will be the path of an image file.  The output will be where we save the output image.\nSo our struct looks like this:\nuse std::path::PathBuf;\nuse structopt::StructOpt\n\n#[derive(StructOpt)]\nstruct Opt {\n    #[structopt(parse(from_os_str))]\n    input: PathBuf,\n\n    #[structopt(parse(from_os_str))]\n    output: PathBuf\n}\n\nThe parse(from_os_str) attribute will convert a string argument directly into a PathBuf to save us some boiler plate\nWe can then use this to get a struct with our command line arguments\nfn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;&gt; {\n\n    let opt = Opt::from_args();\n    ....\n}\nLoading Image Data\nWe need to provide the tensorflow graph with our image data.  So how do we do that? We use a Tensor!  Tensors represent data within our graph, it sort of reminds me of sending vertices to a GPU.  You have a big slice of data, and send it in a format that tensorflow is expecting.\nThe input tensor in this graph is an array of floats, with dimensions: height x width x 3 (for 3 colour channels).\nLet's use the image crate to load the image:\nlet input_image = image::open(&amp;opt.input)?;\n\nNext we want to convert this image into its raw pixels by using the GenericImage::pixels function and send that to our graph. All multi-dimensional Tensor arrays are flat, and stored in row major order.  The model uses BGR instead of the traditional RGB for colours, so we'll need to reverse the pixel values when we iterate through.\nPutting it all together:\nlet mut flattened: Vec&lt;f32&gt; = Vec::new();\n\nfor (_x, _y, rgb) in input_image.pixels() {\n    flattened.push(rgb[2] as f32);\n    flattened.push(rgb[1] as f32);\n    flattened.push(rgb[0] as f32);\n}\n\nThis simply iterates through the pixels, adding them to a flattened Vec.\nWe can then load this into a tensor, specifying the image height and width as arguments:\nlet input = Tensor::new(&amp;[input_image.height() as u64, input_image.width() as u64, 3])\n    .with_values(&amp;flattened)?\n\nGreat! we have loaded our image into a format that the graph understands.  Let's run a session!\nCreating a tensorflow session\nOk, we have a graph, the input image, but now we need a session for the graph.  We'll just use the defaults for this:\nlet session = Session::new(&amp;SessionOptions::new(), &amp;graph)?;\nRunning a session\nBefore we run a session, we have a few other inputs the mtcnn model is expecting.  We're gonna use the same defaults the mtcnn library for these values:\nlet min_size = Tensor::new(&amp;[]).with_values(&amp;[40f32])?;\nlet thresholds = Tensor::new(&amp;[3]).with_values(&amp;[0.6f32, 0.7f32, 0.7f32])?;\nlet factor = Tensor::new(&amp;[]).with_values(&amp;[0.709f32])?;\n\nThe graph can define multiple inputs/outputs that are required before running and it depends on the specific neural net as to what these are.  For MTCNN, these are all described in the original implementation.  Probably the most important one is the min_size which describes the minimum size to find faces.\nNow we build the session arguments for the inputs:\nlet mut args = SessionRunArgs::new();\n\n//Load our parameters for the model\nargs.add_feed(&amp;graph.operation_by_name_required(\"min_size\")?, 0, &amp;min_size);\nargs.add_feed(&amp;graph.operation_by_name_required(\"thresholds\")?, 0, &amp;thresholds);\nargs.add_feed(&amp;graph.operation_by_name_required(\"factor\")?, 0, &amp;factor);\n\n//Load our input image\nargs.add_feed(&amp;graph.operation_by_name_required(\"input\")?, 0, &amp;input);\n\nOk, what about outputs? There are two that we are going to request when the session is finished: bounding boxes and probabilities:\nlet bbox = args.request_fetch(&amp;graph.operation_by_name_required(\"box\")?, 0);\nlet prob = args.request_fetch(&amp;graph.operation_by_name_required(\"prob\")?, 0);\n\nOk cool, we have our inputs, and our outputs, let's run it!\nsession.run(&amp;mut args)?;\nThe BBox struct\nThe model outputs the following values:\n\nBounding box of the faces\nLandmarks of the faces\nProbability that it's a face from 0 to 1\n\nIn order to make it a bit more easy to work with, we'll define a bounding box struct which encodes those values back in a more easy to read fashion:\n#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug)]\npub struct BBox {\n    pub x1: f32,\n    pub y1: f32,\n    pub x2: f32,\n    pub y2: f32,\n    pub prob: f32,\n}\n\nWe'll omit landmarks for simplicity, but can always add them back if we need.  Our job is to convert the arrays we get back from the tensorflow session into this struct so it's more meaningful.\nSaving the Output\nRight, now let's grab back the outputs.  Just like inputs, outputs are Tensors too:\nlet bbox_res: Tensor&lt;f32&gt; = args.fetch(bbox)?;\nlet prob_res: Tensor&lt;f32&gt; = args.fetch(prob)?;\n\nWhat is the shape of bbox? Well, it's a multi-dimensional flattened array that includes 4 floats per bounding box representing the bounding box extents.  The prob is an array with a single float value per face: the probability from 0 to 1.  So we should expect the bbox_res length to be the number of faces x 4, and prob_res to be equal to the number of faces.\nLet's do some basic iteration and store our results into a Vec:\n\n//Let's store the results as a Vec&lt;BBox&gt;\nlet mut bboxes = Vec::new();\n\nlet mut i = 0;\nlet mut j = 0;\n\n//While we have responses, iterate through\nwhile i &lt; bbox_res.len() {\n\n    //Add in the 4 floats from the `bbox_res` array. \n    //Notice the y1, x1, etc.. is ordered differently to our struct definition.\n    bboxes.push(BBox {\n        y1: bbox_res[i],\n        x1: bbox_res[i + 1],\n        y2: bbox_res[i + 2],\n        x2: bbox_res[i + 3],\n        prob: prob_res[j], // Add in the facial probability\n    });\n\n    //Step `i` ahead by 4. \n    i += 4;\n    //Step `i` ahead by 1. \n    j += 1;\n}\nCombinators\nAlternatively, we could use combinators to replace the one above.\nlet bboxes: Vec&lt;_&gt; = bbox_res\n    .chunks_exact(4) // Split into chunks of 4\n    .zip(prob_res.iter()) // Combine it with prob_res\n    .map(|(bbox, &amp;prob)| BBox {\n        y1: bbox[0],\n        x1: bbox[1],\n        y2: bbox[2],\n        x2: bbox[3],\n        prob,\n    })\n    .collect();\nPrinting out the bounding boxes\nOk, we haven't encoded the bounding boxes into an image, yet. but let's debug to make sure we're getting back something:\nprintln!(\"BBox Length: {}, Bboxes:{:#?}\", bboxes.len(), bboxes);\n\nRunning this, what do we get back:\nBBox Length: 120, BBoxes:[\n    BBox {\n        x1: 471.4591,\n        y1: 287.59888,\n        x2: 495.3053,\n        y2: 317.25327,\n        prob: 0.9999908\n    },\n    ....\n\nWhoa! 120 faces! Awesome!\nDrawing the Bounding Boxes\nGreat, we have some bounding boxes.  Let's draw them on the image, and save the output into a file.\nTo draw bounding boxes, we can use the imageproc library to draw simple borders around the bounding boxes.\nFirstly, we'll make the line colour constant green outside of our main() function:\nconst LINE_COLOUR: Rgba&lt;u8&gt; = Rgba {\n        data: [0, 255, 0, 0],\n};\n\nNow stepping back into it.  We are feeding in the input image read only, so let's use the first image to draw onto:\nlet mut output_image = input_image;\n\nThen we iterate through our bounding boxes:\nfor bbox in bboxes {\n    //Drawing Happens Here!\n}\n\nNext, we use the draw_hollow_rect_mut function.  This will take a mutable image reference, and draw a hollow rectangle (outline) specified by the input Rect, overwriting any existing pixels.\nThe Rect takes an x and y coordinate with the at function, and then a width and height with the of_size function.  We use a bit of geometry to convert our bounding box to this format:\nlet rect = Rect::at(bbox.x1 as i32, bbox.y1 as i32)\n    .of_size((bbox.x2 - bbox.x1) as u32, (bbox.y2 - bbox.y1) as u32);\n\nThen draw the rect:\ndraw_hollow_rect_mut(&amp;mut output_image, rect, LINE_COLOUR);\n\nOnce the for loop is done, we save it in the output file:\noutput_image.save(&amp;opt.output)?;\n\nAnd we're done.

I noted back then that tmq is great if you need to interact with other languages, but may be a little overkill if you are just using rust.  I wondered what it'd take to build the job queue with a smaller library footprint, using something like tokio-serde instead of tmq.  It was successful, and this blog will step through some of the changes needed.\nTo follow along, these changes are on the tokio_serde branch of the jobq repo.\nIf you are getting lost make sure you review the last blog to see some of the logic &amp; design tradeoffs.\nWhat is Tokio-Serde\nTokio-Serde is a little glue library that allows you to serialise/deserialise objects on the wire. With the help of tokio-util's codec feature, you can use Tokio-Serde to encode/decode bytes into discrete messages to be passed on the wire.\nFrom the Tokio-Serde documentation using tokio-serde is 3 layers deep:\n\ntokio::net::TcpStream: The raw Stream/Sink where we can get/send bytes\ntokio_util::codec::Framed: The ability to chunk bytes into discrete frames\ntokio_serde::Framed: The ability to take these frames &amp; then serialize/deserialize them\n\nThe TCP Stream\nThe TCP stream is your standard tcp connection.  In tokio, you can either bind or connect to a TCP socket.\nWith connect, you will get a straight tcp stream, if successful:\nlet tcp_stream = TcpStream::connect(\"127.0.0.1:17653\").await?;\n\nWith bind you will get a listener, which will produce tcp streams when new connections come in:\nlet mut listener = TcpListener::bind(\"127.0.0.1:17653\").await?;\n\nwhile let Some(tcp_stream) = listener.try_next().await? {\n    //do something with the tcp stream\n}\nThe Frame\nOk so we have bytes coming across the wire now from our standard TCP stream.  As bytes come in, the tcp stream will be woken up so work can commence on it.  But TCP streams do not have a beginning or end, they are just a stream of bytes. We need something to break up this stream of bytes into discrete objects.  This is where tokio_util::codec::Framed comes in: it chunks down bytes on the wire into frames.\nThe tokio_util crate comes with the Encoder/Decoder traits which allow you to implement this.  tokio-util also comes with a simple, Length Delimited Codec which, on the wire looks like this:\n+----------+--------------------------------+\n| length   |          payload               |\n+----------+--------------------------------+\n\nWhen decoding, this will read the length header, allocate some memory and wait until the payload is fully delivered.  If there are not enough bytes on the wire to do this, then it will be continuously polled until it is ready, keeping around a buffer. The semantics of Decoder mean that if you return no bytes, then it's an indication there needs to be more to decode a frame successfully.\nWhen encoding, the whole thing is ready to go, so tack on the length, your payload and let tokio handle the rest.\nThe Serde Frame\nWe now have some raw bytes that have been bundled into frames which can be encoded/decoded from the raw bytes into something more meaningful.  Rather than implement this by hand, we can rely on tokio-serde with one of the existing codecs, such as JSON, CBOR, Bincode or Messagepack.\nOur existing job queue uses CBOR so we'll use that here as well.  We can use the same messages we have previously used but we will condense down the Client/Worker to just ClientMessage:\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]\npub enum ServerMessage {\n    Hello(String), // Hello with client name\n    Request(JobRequest),\n    Completed(Job),\n    Failed(Job, String),\n}\n\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]\npub enum ClientMessage {\n    Hello(String),\n    Order(Job),\n    Acknowledged(Job),\n}\n\nPutting these 3 layers together, we get a Stream/Sink we can send values to:\nlet tcp_stream = TcpStream::connect(addr).await?;\n\nlet length_delimited = tokio_util::codec::Framed::new(tcp_stream, LengthDelimitedCodec::new());\n\nlet connection = tokio_serde::Framed::new(length_delimited, Cbor::default());\n\nWith that we have our transport that we want: length delimited cbor frames.  On the wire this is not too different to ZeroMQ, but would probably shave a few bytes here and there.  Now we need to implement the Server/Client components.\nImplementing a Server\nWe want to accept connections from clients/workers and then route out messages to the appropriate connection.  We will leave the server logic itself mostly untouched, and instead replace the tmq::router with a new Router  struct which uses tokio-serde\nThe Router\nThe Router struct handles incoming client connections and allows our server logic to send messages based upon their name.\nWe have multiple clients/workers that will be connecting to our jobq server so we will need to keep around some state to handle those connections.  How will we do that? Well, a simple HashMap&lt;String, Connection&gt; is probably a good start.  When a connection comes in, we want to add it to our map of known clients.\nIf a connection drops off (i.e, returns Poll::Ready(None) from the Stream) then we can clean it from our known connections. If a new client with the same name comes in, we can just drop off the old client connection (alternatively, we could reject the new one).  These semantics are obviously different from the ZeroMQ Router socket, and not nearly as robust, but are good enough for a PoC.\nThe router can be implemented as a Stream which, when polled will check:\n\nAny pending tcp connections\nAny pending clients that are in the middle of handshaking\nAny pending messages from existing clients\n\nThis can be seen as a loop, whereby each time we hit poll_next we will hit all 3 areas in case we have anything waiting for us.  If there is nothing in one area, then we move onto the next one, and so on.  We can do an if let Poll::Ready() pattern here to skip things that aren't ready.\nPending Clients\nHow do we know the client name when connecting?  Well we can implement a list of pending clients.  When they send a ServerMessage::Hello  message, we can then put them in our known clients list.  This is a pretty lightweight handshake, but accomplishes our goals.\nFirst, we convert the tcp stream from listener into a list of pending clients:\nlet self_mut = &amp;mut self.as_mut();\n\nif let Poll::Ready(val) = Pin::new(&amp;mut self_mut.listener).poll_next(cx) {\n    match val {\n        Some(Ok(tcp_stream)) =&gt; {\n            let length_delimited =\n                CodecFramed::new(tcp_stream, LengthDelimitedCodec::new());\n\n            let framed = Framed::new(length_delimited, Cbor::default());\n\n            self_mut.pending_clients.push(framed);\n        }\n        Some(Err(err)) =&gt; {\n            error!(\"Error checking for new requests:{:?}\", err);\n        }\n        None =&gt; {\n            return Poll::Ready(None);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nNow, with that checked off, we can then consult our pending clients.  Note here I am swapping out the pending clients Vec with an empty Vec to avoid doubly borrowing as mutable.  There may be an easier/more efficient way of doing this and would be interested in knowing what that may look like.\nWe will repopulate the list as we go through, so we won't lose any pending clients, but one or two may drop off if they are not doing the handshake correctly or they have already disconnected.  We'll also add the Hello message to our messages to send as a Stream response.  That's our buffer that we will be using.\nlet mut new_pending = Vec::new();\nmem::swap(&amp;mut self_mut.pending_clients, &amp;mut new_pending);\n\nfor mut pending in new_pending.into_iter() {\n    if let Poll::Ready(val) = Pin::new(&amp;mut pending).poll_next(cx) {\n        match val {\n            Some(Ok(ServerMessage::Hello(name))) =&gt; {\n                debug!(\"New Client connection from `{}`\", name);\n                self_mut.buffer.push(ServerMessage::Hello(name.clone()));\n                self_mut.clients.insert(name, pending);\n            }\n            Some(Ok(msg)) =&gt; {\n                warn!(\"Received unknown message during handshake:{:?}\", msg);\n            }\n            Some(Err(err)) =&gt; {\n                error!(\"Error checking for new requests:{:?}\", err);\n            }\n            None =&gt; (),\n        }\n    } else {\n        self_mut.pending_clients.push(pending);\n    }\n}\nExisting Clients\nWe'll do the same trick for the client HashMap: swap it out for an empty one as we're processing.\nWe'll put all received messages into an internal buffer, which we will use later to send the actual response from the stream.\nlet mut new_clients = HashMap::new();\nmem::swap(&amp;mut self_mut.clients, &amp;mut new_clients);\n\nfor (name, mut client) in new_clients.into_iter() {\n    match Pin::new(&amp;mut client).poll_next(cx) {\n        Poll::Ready(Some(Ok(val))) =&gt; {\n            trace!(\"Received message from `{}`: {:?}\", name, val);\n            self_mut.buffer.push(val);\n            self_mut.clients.insert(name, client);\n        }\n        Poll::Ready(None) =&gt; {\n            //Finished\n            debug!(\"Client `{}` disconnecting\", name);\n        }\n        Poll::Ready(Some(Err(err))) =&gt; {\n            //Error\n            error!(\"Error from `{}`: {} Removing connection.\", name, err);\n        }\n        Poll::Pending =&gt; {\n            self_mut.clients.insert(name, client);\n        }\n    }\n}\nReturning Messages\nWe've buffered up the returned messages into a Vec and we can return one.  But if there are more after popping we can let the waker know we may have more stuff to process:\nif let Some(val) = self_mut.buffer.pop() {\n    if self_mut.buffer.len() &gt; 0 {\n        cx.waker().wake_by_ref();\n    }\n    return Poll::Ready(Some(Ok(val)));\n}\n\nreturn Poll::Pending;\nSending Messages\nSending messages requires that you know the name of the client, but it is otherwise a simple wrapper:\npub async fn send_message(&amp;mut self, client: &amp;str, msg: ClientMessage) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt; {\n    if let Some(connection) = self.clients.get_mut(client) {\n        connection.send(msg).await?;\n    } else {\n        return Err(anyhow!(\"Client `{}` not connected!\", client));\n    }\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n\nWe can even expose a way to check if any clients are connected of that name, and simply not bother sending a message in this case:\npub fn is_connected(&amp;self, client: &amp;str) -&gt; bool {\n    self.clients.contains_key(client)\n}\nChanges to the Server\nThe Server struct itself does not really change all that much.  Instead of using a tmq::router we'll use our new Router.  Although strictly not equivalent, for the purpose of the job queue, this is an OK analogue:\nlet mut router = Router::new(&amp;self.job_address).await?;\n\nwhile let Some(server_msg) = router.next().await {\n    // existing server logic here\n}\nImplementing Clients\nNot much has changed here as well.  We could get away with not using our own struct definition here at all and just set up a connection, but would be great if we had something we could plop in where the old tmq::dealer was used.\nDealer\nWe implement a Dealer struct which simply wraps a tokio_serde::Framed:\ntype ClientFramed = Framed&lt;\n    CodecFramed&lt;TcpStream, LengthDelimitedCodec&gt;,\n    ClientMessage,\n    ServerMessage,\n    Cbor&lt;ClientMessage, ServerMessage&gt;,\n&gt;;\n\npub struct Dealer {\n    connection: ClientFramed,\n}\n\nimpl Dealer {\n    pub async fn new&lt;A: ToSocketAddrs&gt;(addr: A) -&gt; Result&lt;Self, Error&gt; {\n        let tcp_stream = TcpStream::connect(addr).await?;\n\n        let length_delimited = CodecFramed::new(tcp_stream, LengthDelimitedCodec::new());\n\n        let connection = Framed::new(length_delimited, Cbor::default());\n\n        Ok(Self { connection })\n    }\n}\n\nWith the dealer, both receiving and sending marry up with Stream and Sink quite well, so we can implement that quite easily:\nimpl Stream for Dealer {\n    type Item = Result&lt;ClientMessage, Error&gt;;\n\n    fn poll_next(mut self: Pin&lt;&amp;mut Self&gt;, cx: &amp;mut Context&lt;'_&gt;) -&gt; Poll&lt;Option&lt;Self::Item&gt;&gt; {\n        let self_mut = &amp;mut self.as_mut();\n\n        match Pin::new(&amp;mut self_mut.connection).poll_next(cx) {\n            Poll::Ready(Some(val)) =&gt; Poll::Ready(Some(val.map_err(|err| err.into()))),\n            Poll::Ready(None) =&gt; Poll::Ready(None),\n            Poll::Pending =&gt; Poll::Pending,\n        }\n    }\n}\nWorker Changes\nThe worker doesn't change much, we call split on the Dealer struct to get our two pipes, but otherwise treat it as per normal:\nlet (mut send_skt, recv) = Dealer::new(&amp;job_address).await?.split();\nRunning the Changes\nRunning the branch we should see a lot of the same chatter we saw from the previous version:\n 2020-05-13 11:13:02 DEBUG jobq::server &gt; New: Job { id: 5500, username: \"test_client\", name: \"test\", uuid: 95182793-7a08-4329-a9f1-4be0c1f1d041, params: Null, priority: Normal, status: Queued }\n 2020-05-13 11:13:02 WARN  jobq::server &gt; Job failed: 5496, Reason: Simulating failure\n 2020-05-13 11:13:02 WARN  jobq::server &gt; Job failed: 5484, Reason: Simulating failure\n 2020-05-13 11:13:02 WARN  jobq::server &gt; Job failed: 5472, Reason: Simulating failure\n 2020-05-13 11:13:03 WARN  jobq::server &gt; Job failed: 5460, Reason: Simulating failure\nConclusion\nImplementing a more barebones messaging system native in rust took not much time at all.  While this solution is not nearly as robust as using ZeroMQ, it does provide a more building blocks approach to messaging, reducing external dependencies.  I found the hardest portion was gluing everything together between the 3 main crates and getting the types right.  Tokio-Serde could use a bit more fleshing out and does seem quite embryonic still, but it is enough to get your hands dirty.\nThe initial design of the jobq made it easy to slot in another transport layer as well.  All the structs &amp; types were all ready and rolling to go, we just needed a couple of extra libraries to fill in the pieces.\n","id":"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/implementing-a-jobq-with-tokio/","title":"Implementing a Job queue with Tokio-Serde"},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/implementing-a-jobq/":{"body":"One of the challenges I have had with on premise solutions is the lack of reliable environments and constrained resources.   Not only are you limited in your ability to control things, you need to ensure that things continue on in the case of failure.\nI was tasked with rewriting the job processing pipeline for my company's product, SchoolBench, to ensure a greater level of robustness in the case of service or system failure.\nThis article steps through an approach to this using async rust &amp; the help of tokio ZeroMQ library: tmq along with tokio-postgres.\nAs some excellent work has been put in bringing tmq to async, I thought it pertinent to look at reapproaching the pipeline using async code.  I have published an initial prototype of what the end result may look like, and will be stepping through the approach here, and some of the tradeoffs I made\nWhy TMQ/ZeroMQ?\nFor those not familiar with ZeroMQ, it is a messaging library with a lot of features, from standard publish/subscribe to more elaborate arrangements.  tmq is a tokio compatible binding that allows you to bridge ZeroMQ with the async world of rust.\nYou would use ZeroMQ if you need to interact with other languages easily and don't want it to be too opinionated on what message formats are being sent.  If you are purely using rust then this may be not be a great fit, but it does still provide you some great interprocess &amp; internetwork capabilities that you won't get from just tokio.\nWe use ZeroMQ in SchoolBench as it is a polyglot application and has a lot of components written in python &amp; java as well as rust.  It is lightweight enough not to cause overheads &amp; complex enough for the use cases I have thrown at it so far.\nPrior Work\nThere are some existing rust based job queues that do similar things and may be more suited to your own personal tastes:\n\nhttps://github.com/kureuil/batch-rs\nhttps://github.com/badboy/oppgave\nhttps://github.com/rusty-celery/rusty-celery\nProbably lots more I haven't found\n\nMost of them use some sort of message broker, such as RabbitMQ or Redis.\nWhat is a Job?\nIt helps to explain what a job is.  In the context of SchoolBench a job is a piece of work that may take some time to do (think seconds), is quite intensive, and may fail. Once an asset is saved into SchoolBench, lots of processes are kicked off in the background to fill in the blanks and provide information about the asset.\nSome examples of jobs are:\n\nRunning Facial Recognition on images using tensorflow\nGenerating Thumbnails and Watermarked renditions of images\nCalculating whether a photo is a duplicate of another photo and marking the set of duplicates\n\nA lot of these are quite intensive &amp; can sometimes fail in weird and wonderful ways:  An image uploaded may be corrupted, so renditions may not run;  There may be an issue running the neural net;  The VM may be experience ballooning and fail to allocate memory, etc...\nSo we need a way of describing a discrete piece of work which may happen some time in the future and may happen by a completely isolated process.\nResource Contention\nWe have very limited resources in an on premise environment. After providing a minimum recommendation it is important to tune for that worst case.  This is different in a cloud environment where you can spin up guests in a work stealing fashion if you throw more money at your infrastructure. on premise is usually more fixed in terms of server and hardware allocations, and so we need to plan for that.\nThis is one area where the job queue deviates from a lot of existing systems out there: we assume we're just running on the one set of CPUs and so there is a fixed number of active jobs at any given time.\nWe also want a simple way to prioritise tasks as they are submitted, so that some jobs finish first, with higher value jobs such as thumbnail generation happening first. The job queue uses a simple 3-tier priority system to do this: High, Medium &amp; Low.\nThis simple system could mean if there are not enough resources to finish jobs then there is a chance that lower tier jobs may never get around to completing.  In practice the sort of work loads we have seen this is not the case, but it is a possibility. In which case more processors would be needed to keep up with the load or another style of priority to be implemented (such as fair queueing).\nPersistence\nJobs need to survive crashes and server restarts in a robust fashion.  Existing job queues utilise an existing persistence layer/message broker such as Redis or RabbitMQ.  I have chosen PostgreSQL as the persistence layer as it is performant enough, and is already in use for metadata storage.  However, you could easily swap out another type of persistence with a bit of refactoring.\nThe Overall Process\nThe high level proces is as follows:\n\nA User Action triggers some sort of logic which requests a job.  This could be an automatic rule somewhere or could be the a user specifically requesting a job to run\nA server listens for requests and puts them into a queue\nIf there are jobs that can be processed then they are submitted to the individual worker who is responsible for finishing the job\nWhen a job completes or fails, then it is marked as so with a duration on how long things take\nEverytime a new event is triggered, such as a job in a queue or a job completed/failed, the server checks to see if it can mark jobs as processing\nAll job status updates &amp; information is persisted to a db, so that things can pick up again if there is a failure &amp; reports can be ran using standard SQL tools\n\nClient, Server, Worker\nWe split the roles of the job queue into 3 different types:\n\nClients that submit requests to the server\nThe Server which does the main job queue loop\nThe Workers that receive jobs and do work, returning whether the work was completed (not the work outcome itself, just the status; we assume that the worker will update something out of band like another db or filesystem)\n\nOne possible thing to note is that there is only ever one server, but there can be as many workers and clients as allowed.  The workers themselves can also be clients and submit requests if they want to.\nCommunication\nThe server, worker and clients all communicate via a ZeroMQ DEALER/ROUTER socket.\nClients and Workers use the DEALER style socket to retrieve &amp; send messages, but also identify themselves, and the server uses ROUTER. The identity is included as the first ZeroMQ multipart frame when it is received and so can be used to route messages back to the appropriate place.\nThe messages are serialised on the wire as CBOR using serde_cbor.  CBOR was chosen because it allows for the message type to be flexible &amp; there are plenty of implementations in other languages.  JSON could be used as well, as arguably the support for JSON is much higher, but would mean larger message sizes. \nWith serde it's pretty easy to adjust what serialisation is used, so some experimentation could be worthwhile.\nThe Job Structs\nThe Job struct is defined as follows (with the Status &amp; Priority enums listed too):\npub struct Job {\n    pub id: i64, // ID of the Job so it can be tracked\n    pub username: String, // Username of who submitted the job\n    pub name: String, // Name of the job/worker, `rendition`, etc..\n    pub uuid: Uuid, // Unique ID of the asset\n    pub params: Value,// Any parameters of the job in question\n    pub priority: Priority, // The priority of the job\n    pub status: Status,// The status of the job\n}\n\nThe job has a current status which starts with Queued, goes to Processing when it is active and then marked as either Completed or Failed:\npub enum Status {\n    Queued,\n    Processing,\n    Completed,\n    Failed,\n}\n\nThe priority is a simple 3-tier system of High, Normal &amp; Low:\npub enum Priority {\n    High,\n    Normal,\n    Low,\n}\nMessage types\nMessages are split up based upon who the destination is with a shared Hello message that can be serialised as any enum:\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]\npub enum ServerMessage {\n    Hello,\n    Request(JobRequest),\n    Completed(Job),\n    Failed(Job, String),\n}\n\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]\npub enum ClientMessage {\n    Hello,\n    Acknowledged(Job),\n}\n\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]\npub enum WorkerMessage {\n    Hello,\n    Order(Job),\n}\n\nThe  JobRequest is very similar to a Job but does not have an allocated id or status yet:\npub struct JobRequest {\n    pub name: String,\n    pub username: String,\n    pub uuid: Uuid,\n    pub params: Value,\n    pub priority: Priority,\n}\nThe Params Value\nOne thing to note is the params is of the type serde_json::Value.  This is really to allow the greatest flexibility into what parameters are sent with each job &amp; also to have it persist to PostgreSQL as a jsonb column.\nAlternatively, a tighter enum could be used for different job names if you knew ahead of time the jobs that will be requested.\nSerialisation helpers\nTo reduce some of the repetitiveness, there is a serialisation helper which simply serialises to CBOR for any struct that implements Serialize:\npub trait ToMpart {\n    fn to_mpart(&amp;self) -&gt; Result&lt;Multipart, Error&gt;;\n\n    fn to_msg(&amp;self) -&gt; Result&lt;Message, Error&gt;;\n}\n\nimpl&lt;T: serde::ser::Serialize&gt; ToMpart for T {\n    fn to_mpart(&amp;self) -&gt; Result&lt;Multipart, Error&gt; {\n        let bytes = serde_cbor::to_vec(&amp;self)?;\n\n        Ok(Multipart::from(vec![&amp;bytes]))\n    }\n\n    fn to_msg(&amp;self) -&gt; Result&lt;Message, Error&gt; {\n        let bytes = serde_cbor::to_vec(&amp;self)?;\n\n        Ok(Message::from(&amp;bytes))\n    }\n}\nClient Requests\nClients can send requests by constructing job requests and sending them to the server.  They just need to construct the Request enum and send it on the wire:\nlet (mut send, mut recv) = dealer(&amp;Context::new())\n    .set_identity(b\"test_client\")\n    .connect(&amp;config.job_address)?\n    .split::&lt;Multipart&gt;();\n\nlet job = JobRequest {\n    name: \"test\".into(),\n    username: \"test_client\".into(),\n    params: Value::Null,\n    uuid: Uuid::new_v4(),\n    priority: PriorityLow,\n};\n\nsend.send(ServerMessage::Request(job).to_mpart()?).await?;\nWorker Processing\nFor workers doing the work, they should do something &amp; then return whether it's failed or completed.\nTo make this easier, a Worker trait is implemented.  Since some work will be async &amp; some not, we want our trait to be async-capable.  At the writing of this article you can't have async in trait definitions, but there is the async_trait crate that allows you to decorate a trait definition and do what we're after.\nFor errors we're going to use the anyhow crate, but a more generic error approach could be used with a bit of a refactor.\n#[async_trait]\npub trait Worker: Sized {\n    const JOB_NAME: &amp;'static str;\n\n    async fn process(&amp;self, job: Job) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt;\n}\n\nThe implementation of this trait means that you can do lots within the process body and simplifies it.\nAn original version had the process method accept &amp;mut self, but that caused some contention when trying to process jobs concurrently.  Instead you'll need some interior mutability if you need to provide any mutable references to &amp;self.\nAs an example, the test worker will simply wait for 100 milliseconds and then fail every 12th job based upon the id:\nimpl Worker for TestWorker {\n    const JOB_NAME: &amp;'static str = \"test\";\n\n    async fn process(&amp;self, job: Job) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt; {\n        delay_for(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;\n        if job.id % 12 == 0 {\n            return Err(anyhow!(\"Simulating failure\"));\n        }\n\n        Ok(())\n    }\n}\nThe Work Method\nThere is another method, work, on the trait which sets up &amp; hides some of the complexity away of getting a worker to listen for requests coming through.   This is plumbing to make it easy to run a Worker.\nasync fn work(&amp;self, job_address: &amp;str) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt; {\n    ...\n} \n\nYou can await this method for anything that implements Worker to have it process incoming requests:\nuse jobq::worker::{Worker, TestWorker};\n\ntokio::spawn(async move {\n    if let Err(err) = TestWorker.work(&amp;worker_config.job_address).await {\n        error!(\"{}\", err);\n    }\n});\n\nUnder the hood it uses the job address to communicate with a Server and glues up some requests\nFirstly, it creates a dealer socket, setting the identity accordingly:\nlet (mut send_skt, recv) = dealer(&amp;Context::new())\n    .set_identity(job_name.as_bytes())\n    .connect(&amp;job_address)?\n    .split::&lt;Multipart&gt;();\n\nAs ZeroMQ sockets are Send but not Sync, we spin up a background task connected by an unbounded queue which allows the sender to be cloned.  This allows both heartbeats to be sent every 10 seconds from a background task &amp; also send results of processing:\nlet (send, mut recv_skt) = unbounded::&lt;ServerMessage&gt;();\n\ntokio::spawn(async move {\n    while let Some(jobq_message) = recv_skt.next().await {\n        if let Ok(msg) = jobq_message.to_mpart() {\n            if let Err(err) = send_skt.send(msg).await {\n                error!(\"Error sending message:{}\", err);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n});\n\nThe 10 second heartbeat is similiarly set up as a separate task:\ntokio::spawn(async move {\n    loop {\n        if let Err(err) = ping_sender.send(ServerMessage::Hello).await {\n            error!(\"Error:{}\", err);\n        };\n        delay_for(Duration::from_millis(10000)).await;\n    }\n});\n\nThere is then a big combinator statement which in effect listens for job requests &amp; then runs them in parallel:\nrecv.filter_map(|val| {\n    match val\n        .map_err(Error::from)\n        .and_then(|msg| serde_cbor::from_slice(&amp;msg[0]).map_err(Error::from))\n    {\n        Ok(WorkerMessage::Order(job)) =&gt; return ready(Some(job)),\n        Ok(WorkerMessage::Hello) =&gt; {\n            debug!(\"Pong: {}\", job_type);\n        }\n        Err(err) =&gt; {\n            error!(\"Error decoding message:{}\", err);\n        }\n    }\n\n    return ready(None);\n})\n.map(|job| (self.process(job.clone()), send.clone(), job))\n.for_each_concurrent(None, |(status, mut send, job)| async move {\n    let server_message = match status.await {\n        Ok(()) =&gt; ServerMessage::Completed(job),\n        Err(err) =&gt; ServerMessage::Failed(job, err.to_string()),\n    };\n\n    if let Err(err) = send.send(server_message).await {\n        error!(\"Error sending server message: {}\", err);\n    }\n})\n.await;\n\nThere is a bit of cloning here that could probably be avoided, but the overhead of cloning a job is not that big.\nThe for_each_concurrent allows the worker to run concurrently, and is one of the reasons the trait takes &amp;self rather than &amp;mut self.\nAll of this is essentially generic on the Worker trait, meaning this plumbing is handled for you when you call work(&amp;address).\nBlocking Tasks\nSome tasks may be blocking, which is a no-no in the async world.  If one of the async worker threads is blocked then it can't listen for more events &amp; will slow things down.  Luckily tokio does provide the spawn_blocking helper for executing blocking work on a dedicated threadpool:\nlet result =\n   tokio::task::spawn_blocking(move || do_blocking_work(job));\n\nresult.await??;\n\nThe double .await?? is because the JoinHandle returned from spawn_blocking itself could fail and the internal result from the closure could fail.\nTo control how many threads are used for blocking operations, you need to manually build your tokio run time, rather than use the tokio::main macro.\nThe the number of blocking threads is max_threads - core_threads.  For instance, if you wanted only 2 dedicated blocking threads:\nlet mut rt = tokio::runtime::Builder::new()\n    .threaded_scheduler()\n    .enable_all()\n    .core_threads(4)\n    .max_threads(6)\n    .build()?\nThe Server Loop\nThe server loop is the main loop responsible for coordinating tasks &amp; otherwise tasks are finished in the order they are supposed to.  The server here responds to messages from the ZeroMQ socket &amp; acts according to the message received.\nSetup Phase\nThe setup phase involves setting up a db handle, then querying the database for any outstanding processing jobs.  This is to ensure that they don't become stuck as part of a server restart, but can mean that there may be duplicate jobs submitted.  If your jobs provide the same outcome based upon the job at hand this isn't a big deal, so the workers should do work that is idempotent if at all possible.\nOnce that is done, the server keeps an active count of jobs &amp; increments/decrements them when jobs finish/fail or start.\nMain Loop\nThe main loop simply waits until a message is received, and acts accordingly:\nwhile let Some(msg) = recv.try_next().await? {\n\n    // This is the `ROUTER` socket identity\n    let client_name = &amp;msg[0];\n    // This is the message\n    let server_msg = serde_cbor::from_slice::&lt;ServerMessage&gt;(&amp;msg[1]);\n    \n    match server_msg {\n        ...\n    }\n\n}\nHello Message\nIf a Hello message is received then the server will send any outstanding processing jobs it knows about:\n//Drain out existing processing jobs\nlet (jobs, outstanding): (Vec&lt;Job&gt;, Vec&lt;Job&gt;) =\n    processing.into_iter().partition(|job| job.name == name);\n\nprocessing = outstanding;\n\nfor job in jobs {\n    send_job(&amp;handle, job, &amp;mut send).await?;\n}\n\nThe processing vec is only ever populated at server start, and so should mostly be empty unless the server was restarted with jobs that were active.\nAfter checking all this it responds back with a Hello\nJob Request\nIf a Request message comes in, the server adds this to the db &amp; then sends an Acknowledged message back to the client with the populated details.  This doesn't yet start the job however, merely it sets the job in a Queued state.\nCompleted\nIf a Completed message comes in then the server marks it as completed decrementing the active job count.\nFailed\nIf a Failed message comes in the server will mark the job as failed and submit the reason with it, decrementing the active job count\nError Deserialising\nThere is a possibility that a connected client could send an invalid message, so we just log with a warn level in this case, skipping the message:\nmatch server_msg {\n    ....\n    Err(err) =&gt; {\n        warn!(\"Could not deserialize message:{}\", err);\n    }\n}\nSubmit Tasks\nAfter the main loop matching against the message types, the server checks to see if there are any active slots &amp; if so, queries the database for any queued jobs:\n// If we have less active tasks lets check the queued stuff\nif active &lt; self.num {\n    let jobs = handle\n        .get_queued_jobs(self.num as i64 - active as i64)\n        .await?;\n\n    for job in jobs {\n        send_job(&amp;handle, job, &amp;mut send).await?;\n        active = active + 1;\n    }\n}\n\nAfter this processing, the server then waits again for the next message.\nDatabase Persistence\nOne of the requirements is ensuring that jobs stay around and are persisted somewhere.   The prototype uses PostgreSQL to do this.\nAs this is async, we'll use tokio-postgres to perform updates.  tokio postgres has some nice docs to get us started, so we will use their example to build a database handler:\nuse tokio_postgres::{NoTls, Error};\n\n#[tokio::main] // By default, tokio_postgres uses the tokio crate as its runtime.\nasync fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt; {\n    // Connect to the database.\n    let (client, connection) =\n        tokio_postgres::connect(\"host=localhost user=postgres\", NoTls).await?;\n\n    // The connection object performs the actual communication with the database,\n    // so spawn it off to run on its own.\n    tokio::spawn(async move {\n        if let Err(e) = connection.await {\n            eprintln!(\"connection error: {}\", e);\n        }\n    });\n\n    // Now we can execute a simple statement that just returns its parameter.\n    let rows = client\n        .query(\"SELECT $1::TEXT\", &amp;[&amp;\"hello world\"])\n        .await?;\n\n    // And then check that we got back the same string we sent over.\n    let value: &amp;str = rows[0].get(0);\n    assert_eq!(value, \"hello world\");\n\n    Ok(())\n}\nEnums and Postgres Types\nYou can use the postgres_types crate to save simple enums to a table.\nSo the Priority struct can be persisted to the db like so:\nCREATE TYPE \"Priority\" as enum ('High', 'Normal', 'Low');\nA Simple Migration\nHopefully our schema never changes.. Right?\nWell, in the prototype it won't. So we can simply embed an SQL script to run when the a db handler starts up:\npub struct DbHandle {\n    client: Arc&lt;Client&gt;,\n}\n\nimpl DbHandle {\n    pub(crate) async fn new(url: &amp;str) -&gt; Result&lt;Self, Error&gt; {\n        let (client, connection) = tokio_postgres::connect(&amp;url, NoTls).await?;\n\n        tokio::spawn(async move {\n            if let Err(e) = connection.await {\n                error!(\"connection error: {}\", e);\n            }\n        });\n\n        client.batch_execute(include_str!(\"setup.sql\")).await?;\n\n        Ok(DbHandle {\n            client: Arc::new(client),\n        })\n    }\n    ...\n}\n\nThis setup.sql script should be designed to run more than once, but skip the parts that it's already done.  There are a couple tricks to do this, but obviously doesn't work if you are adding/removing columns from a table etc..\nFor the enum types, you can just check the pg_type to make sure that they exist &amp; if not add them:\nIF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_type WHERE typname = 'Status') THEN\n    CREATE TYPE \"Status\" as enum ('Queued', 'Processing', 'Completed', 'Failed');\nEND IF\n\nWith the table &amp; indexes you can do a CREATE &lt;blah&gt; IF NOT EXISTS:\nCREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS status_idx ON jobq (\n    status\n);\n\nThis won't error out if the index/table already exists, meaning you're safe to run the setup.sql multiple times!\nGetting jobs from the DB\nQuerying for jobs is quite simple, you just select the columns you want and do a get() or try_get() on them:\nimpl DbHandle {\n    ....\n    pub(crate) async fn get_queued_jobs(&amp;self, num: i64) -&gt; Result&lt;Vec&lt;Job&gt;, Error&gt; {\n        let query = \"select \n                        id,\n                        name,\n                        username,\n                        uuid,\n                        params,\n                        priority,\n                        status\n                     from jobq\n                     where \n                        status = 'Queued'\n                     order by\n                     priority asc, time asc\n                     limit $1\";\n\n        let mut jobs = Vec::new();\n\n        for row in result {\n            let id = row.try_get(0)?;\n            let name = row.try_get(1)?;\n            let username = row.try_get(2)?;\n            let uuid = row.try_get(3)?;\n            let params = row.try_get(4)?;\n            let priority = row.try_get(5)?;\n            let status = row.try_get(6)?;\n\n            jobs.push({\n                Job {\n                    id,\n                    username,\n                    name,\n                    uuid,\n                    params,\n                    priority,\n                    status,\n                }\n            });\n        }\n\n        Ok(jobs)\n    }\n    ...\n\nThere are a number of other methods as complete_job, fail_job that handle the SQL stuff &amp; make it simple for the Server to use.\nKeeping things persisted in the database means we can use standard SQL tools to introspect the job queue and see where it's at.\nRecording the job duration\nThe duration of the job is recorded when the job is finished/failed:\npub(crate) async fn complete_job(&amp;self, id: i64) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt; {\n    let query = \"update jobq set status = 'Completed', duration = extract(epoch from now() - \\\"time\\\") where id = $1\";\n\n    self.client.query(query, &amp;[&amp;id]).await?;\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n\nThis could've been done inside rust as well using Instant but would require a bit more state to be handled in the Server.  I've elected here to use a PostgreSQL solution instead to lean on the db.\nRunning the example\nThe example starts the test worker, a server and a client to submit 500 simple jobs:\nfor i in 0..500 {\n    let priority = if i % 2 == 0 {\n        Priority::High\n    } else {\n        Priority::Normal\n    };\n\n    let job = JobRequest {\n        name: \"test\".into(),\n        username: \"test_client\".into(),\n        params: Value::Null,\n        uuid: Uuid::new_v4(),\n        priority,\n    };\n\n    send.send(ServerMessage::Request(job).to_mpart()?).await?;\n}\n\nRunning with cargo run you will see the output after some time, with the simulated failures:\n2020-04-14 16:04:33 DEBUG jobq         &gt; Message:Acknowledged(Job { id: 2999, username: \"test_client\", name: \"test\", uuid: fe6e21fc-8064-4c9a-965d-b1d124f2416d, params: Null, priority: High, status: Queued })\n2020-04-14 16:04:33 DEBUG jobq::server &gt; New: Job { id: 3000, username: \"test_client\", name: \"test\", uuid: d20b4e9b-477b-45ca-9a6a-1f6423378779, params: Null, priority: Normal, status: Queued }\n2020-04-14 16:04:33 DEBUG jobq         &gt; Message:Acknowledged(Job { id: 3000, username: \"test_client\", name: \"test\", uuid: d20b4e9b-477b-45ca-9a6a-1f6423378779, params: Null, priority: Normal, status: Queued })\n2020-04-14 16:04:39 WARN  jobq::server &gt; Job failed: 3000, Reason: Simulating failure\n2020-04-14 16:04:39 WARN  jobq::server &gt; Job failed: 2988, Reason: Simulating failure\n2020-04-14 16:04:39 WARN  jobq::server &gt; Job failed: 2976, Reason: Simulating failure\n\nYou can also run some simple stats directly against the db to see how long things have taken (hopefully ~100ms):\nselect avg(duration) from jobq;\n\n    avg     \n------------\n 0.10634147\n(1 row)\nConclusions\nI hope for anyone new that this article will help dip their feet into the waters of rust and async to see what can be built.\nTaking a few libraries and gluing them together we can get a pretty decent, albeit rough, outline of a background job queue.  The new async/await ecosystem while embryonic already has the tools there to build some cool stuff.\nThere will be a separate article around the release of tmq version 0.2.0 and some of the changes that have been made, but thought it might be great to provide a good example of working code before getting aroudn to that.\n","id":"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/implementing-a-jobq/","title":"Implementing a Job queue with Tokio, PostgreSQL & ZeroMQ"},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/lorikeet-0-11-0/":{"body":"I have just spent some time doing an initial async version of lorikeet now that the async/await syntax is stable and the ecosystem has caught up.  The major blocker was reqwest, as this is used extensively in the http test.\nThis async version is available now as version 0.11.0.  You can also install the cli by running cargo install lorikeet.\nWhat is Lorikeet\nLorikeet is a command line tool and a rust library to run tests for smoke testing and integration testing.  Lorikeet currently supports bash commands and simple HTTP requests along with system information (RAM, Disk &amp; CPU).  There is more information on the github readme about how to write test files, including how to structure dependent tests and make assertions on the output.\nAs a simple example, here's a test plan to check to see whether reddit is up, and then tries to login if it is:\ncheck_reddit:\n  http: https://www.reddit.com\n  regex: the front page of the internet\n\nlogin_to_reddit:\n  http: \n    url: https://www.reddit.com/api/login/{{user}}\n    form:\n      user: {{user}}\n      passwd: {{pass}}\n      api_type: json\n  jmespath: length(json.errors)\n  matches: 0\n  require:\n    - check_reddit\n\nYou can run this as a simple cli command, ensuring that you have a config.yml looks something like:\nuser: test\npass: test\n\nRunning it you will see the results:\n$ lorikeet -c config.yml test.yml\n- name: check_reddit\n  pass: true\n  output: the front page of the internet\n  duration: 1416.591ms\n\n- name: login_to_reddit\n  pass: true\n  output: 0\n  duration: 1089.0276ms\nSkipping futures 0.1\nIn retrospect, I am glad that I skipped out on rewriting lorikeet with the classic combinator style futures.  The migration from standard blocking code to async code is much easier than writing from combinators.  Having done the former with mpart-async, it felt quite easy to sprinkle in a few async and await statements to get things all wired up.\nAs an example, waiting for the request used to be:\nlet mut response = client\n    .execute(request.build().map_err(|err| format!(\"{:?}\", err))?)\n    .map_err(|err| format!(\"Error connecting to url {}\", err))?;\n\nNow, with async, things are not much different:\nlet response = client\n    .execute(request.build().map_err(|err| format!(\"{:?}\", err))?)\n    .await\n    .map_err(|err| format!(\"Error connecting to url {}\", err))?;\nUsing tokio sync primitives\nTokio has a few primitives that are very close to their std counterparts.\nLorikeet now uses a tokio mutex to record the outcome of each of the steps:\nsteps.lock().await[index] = Status::Completed(outcome);\n\nAlso using an unbounded channel so each step can inform the main runner when they are finished:\nlet (tx, mut rx) = unbounded_channel();\n\n// later on....\n\nif let Some(finished_idx) = rx.recv().await {\n  ...\n}\n\nInteresting to note that the UnboundedSender send() method is not async and does not block either.\nMultipart File Uploads\nThe new version of reqwest does not support file uploads easily.  You don't want to buffer the entire file in memory.  Luckily I have had some experience on how to wire this up with mpart-async, and can reuse some of the learnings there.\nThis does require the tokio-util crate, which bridges AsyncRead/AsyncWrite with Sink/Stream.\nThe relevent glue section is as follows:\nlet file_name = path_struct\n    .file\n    .file_name()\n    .map(|val| val.to_string_lossy().to_string())\n    .unwrap_or_default();\n\nlet file = File::open(&amp;path_struct.file)\n    .await\n    .map_err(|err| format!(\"{:?}\", err))?;\n\nlet reader = Body::wrap_stream(FramedRead::new(file, BytesCodec::new()));\n\nform.part(key, Part::stream(reader).file_name(file_name)\nDetecting Blocking Code\nThere is no annotation or warning whenever you are using blocking code in an async context.  This is an issue especially when porting over older code which was previously blocking.  Chances are I have missed a few sections that are blocking and will need to revisit them accordingly.\nLuckily, the fail case for blocking code is usually reduced throughput, down to the number of worker threads, so it is not cataclysmic if there are some blocking sections in your async code.\nConclusion\nI was happy with the ease at which it was to convert existing sections to async by sprinkling a few keywords here and there.  I am concerned that it is too easy to have blocking sections, so I hope there is some tooling/linting around that in the future.\nPlease give lorikeet a go and try out some of the newer features from the readme!\n","id":"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/lorikeet-0-11-0/","title":"Lorikeet 0.11.0 - Upgrading to async"},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/mpart-async-0-3-0/":{"body":"With the new std::future way of doing things and tokio slowly reaching maturation, it's time to look at updating the libraries out there that are using the old ways.  For one of my libraries, tmq, a Tokio ZeroMQ library, there is some awesome work already done to get this updated.\nBut, I thought it pertinent to at least get my feet in the water to see how hard it would be, from a library maintainer perspective, to update to std::future.  For this effort, I chose my small library: mpart-async.   You can see the changes I have made by comparing the versions here.  This blog is a small collection of notes &amp; gotches I found when porting code across.\nmpart-async is a mostly agnostic library for client side multipart/form-data requests.  There are existing libraries out there, like multipart, but I found the API a little unwieldy for my taste (That: and async support is still in alpha according to the readme). I wanted something that worked, and was simple, but didn't offer an opinion on the web client. I use both the actix client &amp;  hyper to make multipart requests depending on the project.\nThe challenge is that with multipart requests you mostly have fields &amp; binary files.  For binary files, you can appreciate, should not be buffered entirely in memory, but streamed out as the bytes become available.  So mpart-async works with multiple internal streams of files and also provides a convenience wrapper (if using tokio) for sending files given a path.\nA New Example\nAll these changes to support async fn and is it actually easier to consume/use async libraries?\nGiven the hyper example, I would say yes.\nCompare the new example:\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt; {\n    //Setup a mock server to accept connections.\n    //....\n\n    let client = Client::new();\n\n    let mut mpart = MultipartRequest::default();\n\n    mpart.add_field(\"foo\", \"bar\");\n    mpart.add_file(\"test\", \"Cargo.toml\");\n\n    let request = Request::post(\"http://localhost:3000\")\n        .header(\n            CONTENT_TYPE,\n            format!(\"multipart/form-data; boundary={}\", mpart.get_boundary()),\n        )\n        .body(Body::wrap_stream(mpart))?;\n\n    client.request(request).await?;\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n\nWith the older one:\nfn main() {\n    // current_thread::Runtime can't be used because of the blocking file operations\n    let mut rt = Runtime::new().expect(\"new rt\");\n\n    //Setup a mock server to accept connections.\n    //....\n\n    // Open `Cargo.toml` file and create a request\n    let request = File::open(\"Cargo.toml\")\n        .map_err(|e| format!(\"{}\", e))\n        .and_then(|file| {\n            // A Stream of BytesMut decoded from an AsyncRead\n            let framed = FramedRead::new(file, BytesCodec::new());\n\n            let mut mpart = MultipartRequest::default();\n            mpart.add_field(\"foo\", \"bar\");\n            mpart.add_stream(\n                \"foofile\",\n                \"Cargo.toml\",\n                \"application/toml\",\n                framed.map(|b| b.freeze()),\n            );\n            Request::post(\"http://localhost:3000\")\n                .header(\n                    CONTENT_TYPE,\n                    format!(\"multipart/form-data; boundary={}\", mpart.get_boundary()),\n                ).body(Body::wrap_stream(mpart))\n                .into_future()\n                .map_err(|e| format!(\"{}\", e))\n        });\n\n    // Send request\n    let task = request.and_then(|request| {\n        let client = hyper::Client::new();\n        client\n            .request(request)\n            .map_err(|e| format!(\"{}\", e))\n            .and_then(|response| {\n                response\n                    .into_body()\n                    .concat2()\n                    .map_err(|e| format!(\"{}\", e))\n                    .and_then(|body| {\n                        if let Ok(data) = str::from_utf8(&amp;body) {\n                            println!(\"Response: {}\", data);\n                        }\n                        Ok(())\n                    })\n            })\n    });\n\n    rt.block_on(task).expect(\"request failed\");\n}\n\nWhile there are still a few warts (such as having to manually add the boundary header), I find the code a lot more readable and easy to follow, rather than your standard combinator paths.\nNo more Error Associated Type\nThe most drastic change to the Stream trait is that there is no longer an Error associated type.  The old Stream/Future traits had both Item and Error, as it assumed that streams were always going to be fallible.  The new traits do away with the Error associated type.  Instead, if you want your Stream to possibly be an error then you need to return a Result as your Item type.\nFor the Stream trait, the method you implement has changed to poll_next and uses the std::task::Poll enum as a return type.\nThe Poll enum did feel a little inside out when I started using it, but makes sense in terms of there being no Error type.  You don't return a Result&lt;Async&lt;Option&gt;, _&gt;... you instead return a Poll&lt;Option&lt;Result&lt;_,_&gt;&gt;&gt;.\nGenerally, this means if you wrote this:\nreturn Ok(Async::Ready(Some(bytes)))\n\nYou instead will return:\nreturn Poll::Ready(Some(Ok(bytes)))\nStreamExt traits and friends\nAs a consequence of no Error associated type, and an example of different ergonomics, if you are dealing with Result items, you may want to use the TryStreamExt trait instead of StreamExt.  They are basically the same trait but one deals with Result a bit more nicely.  I'm not sure whether a simpler solution will be possible with higher kinded types in the future, but for now it is a tiny bit more complex than futures 0.1.\nInterestingly, the index page for stream docs doesn't currently mention that the TryStreamExt trait exists &amp; I only found out about it by asking questions in the discord chat.\nBut wait, there is also StreamExt from tokio  which is subtly different, but does as of 0.2.10 allow you to run collect() on Result&lt;Bytes, _&gt; item streams.\nWhen would you use either StreamExt?  I would say that if you want to be more general, you should probably use the futures  implementation.  Bearing in mind you can't run try_collect() on Result&lt;Bytes, _&gt; at the moment due to an outstanding issue with the bytes crate.  Why does this matter? Well, hyper passes around streams of Result&lt;Bytes, _&gt; when you are streaming a body in &amp; out of a request.  Working with this particular stream signature is a bit clunky still, but I'm sure that this will be resolved in due course.\nSo we have:\n\nStreamExt from futures that works on Stream that aren't Result\nTryStreamExt from futures that works on Stream that are Result but doesn't work well with Result&lt;Bytes,_&gt; when trying to try_collect()\nStreamExt from tokio that works with Result&lt;Bytes,_&gt; and allows you to collect() to get the output but now means you have a dependency on tokio\n\nThis might end up confusing more than just me, and I do hope that it's simplified in the future.\nLuckily in the core of the API I don't need to use them, only for tests &amp; filestream, which means I'm quite happy to depend on the tokio implementation.\nWrapping inner streams in Pin\nI got tripped up on this for a while, and needed to again ask in chat for the answer here. If you have an inner stream and you want to call poll_next on it, you need to wrap it in a Pin, otherwise the Stream trait does not stick and you will get some gnarly error message with some weird suggestions:\nThe my original shot at the code was:\nstream.stream.poll_next(cx)\n\nBut it needs to be:\nPin::new(&amp;mut stream.stream).poll_next(cx)\n\nThe compiler error message is not too helpful here, and insists I restrict S by Stream, even though it is already restricted by Stream.\nerror[E0599]: no method named `poll_next` found for type `S` in the current scope\n   --&gt; src/lib.rs:282:41\n    |\n282 |                     match stream.stream.poll_next(cx) {\n    |                                         ^^^^^^^^^ method not found in `S`\n    |\n    = help: items from traits can only be used if the type parameter is bounded by the trait\nhelp: the following trait defines an item `poll_next`, perhaps you need to restrict type parameter `S` with it:\n    |\n254 | impl&lt;E, S: futures::Stream + Stream&gt; Stream for MultipartRequest&lt;S&gt;\n    |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nYou need to make sure that your inner stream implements Unpin as well to go down this path:\nimpl&lt;E, S&gt; Stream for MultipartRequest&lt;S&gt;\nwhere\n    S: Stream&lt;Item = Result&lt;Bytes, E&gt;&gt; + Unpin,\nStoring the results from an async fn in a struct\nSome of the methods in tokio are returns from an async fn , like the File::open method, which I use for FileStream.  I found the answer on stack overflow as to how to do this with std::future, since async fn returns an opaque type.\nFor the older version, the OpenFuture was a concrete type:\npub struct FileStream {\n    inner: Option&lt;FramedRead&lt;File, BytesCodec&gt;&gt;,\n    file: OpenFuture&lt;PathBuf&gt;,\n}\n\nThe newer version is a return from an async fn and is opaque, so we wrap it using Box::pin:\npub struct FileStream {\n    inner: Option&lt;FramedRead&lt;File, BytesCodec&gt;&gt;,\n    file: Pin&lt;Box&lt;dyn Future&lt;Output = Result&lt;File, Error&gt;&gt; + Send + Sync&gt;&gt;,\n}\n\nYou can then instantiate this with:\nBox::pin(File::open(file.into()))\n\nThen it's easy to call passing on the context from an existing poll():\nself.file.as_mut().poll(cx)\nNotifying a task\nFileStream has two stages.  One is the future to open the file. The second is streaming out the bytes of the file.  When the future resolves to open the file, I want to notify the context that it should be polled again to start streaming.\nThe old way of doing this was task::current().notify():\nself.inner = Some(FramedRead::new(file, BytesCodec::new()));\ntask::current().notify();\n\nThe new way appears to be using  cx.waker().wake_by_ref() where cx is the context received from the poll:\nself.inner = Some(FramedRead::new(file, BytesCodec::new()));\ncx.waker().wake_by_ref();\n\nI say appears because the test written works without wake_by_ref() being called.  Requires a bit more investigation here I think to know exactly what's going on.  My simple test example works either way, strangely.\nConclusion\nIt is not too onerous to convert to std::future for an existing library.  I would assume the leap from the old tokio-core would be harder, as the changes feel mostly cosmetic here.\nThe omission of the Error associated type to me actually makes things less ergonomic and things a little more fragmented (as evidenced by 3 *StreamExt traits..).  I was an advocate of this initially, but there probably needs to be a bit more work in making this nicer.\nThere are still a lot of libraries out there that will be required to be updated, a lot of old blogs that are no longer relevant, and a lot of exploration that needs to be done to see how the async ecosystem falls out.  But considering the friction of updating is quite small, I am quitely optimistic!\n","id":"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/mpart-async-0-3-0/","title":"Lessons learnt updating a library to std::future"},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/rust-2019/":{"body":"2018 was a massive year for rust, and it's great to reflect back on how far we've all come.  My main wish for the new year is to put on the breaks a little bit, and finish off what has been started without taking on anything majorly new.\nThere are a couple of areas that I feel need more attention than most (purely for selfish reasons of course!):\nCompiler Times, IDE Support and RLS\nI think RLS is great.  I think cargo check is great too.  Sometimes when I am waiting for RLS to finish in VSCode, I run cargo check in a terminal to see who wins the race.  Sometimes I get results faster from the cargo check than I do in RLS.  I'm not sure why that is, it might be that I'm making a lot of small edits, and RLS is constantly restarting. I am assuming that the plumbing for both methods is rather similar.  On average, if I just adjust whitespace on one of my projects, it takes at least 10 seconds to recompile.  If I change any trivial bit of code, this doubles to 20 seconds.\nI would love to have dynamic loading in rust as a first class citizen, but I fear the ABI stabilisation is a far way off (I know you can cheat by using the C ABI and libloading but there is a fair amount of unsafe code, which I'm not comfortable with).  This would alleviate some of the issues around compilation times, by allowing compilation to be broken up into smaller chunks.\nFor instance: I implemented a WebDAV handler with actix-web.  This added a significant portion of time to compilation after the implementation was finished, and the code is mostly decoupled from the rest of the app and sits in its own little route (XML instead of JSON, etc..).  I'd love to be able to just hot-load this as a module, rather than compile it in each time if I'm not even touching this part.  Incremental compilation does help a little bit here.\nBetter IDE Support\nI have been using VSCode as my primary rust IDE for a while now, which is great, but I'd love to be able to use IntelliJ as well.  Each time there is an update, I do give it another shot, and find that there are a couple of problems with it:\n\nWeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee\nAdmittedly, each release of the IntelliJ rust plugin is better than the last, but it is not even close to the support that Java has.  I am hoping that this changes in the future.\nI'd also love to be able to give Oni a go, but currently it's in limbo until I, or someone else, has enough time to work out what is wrong with the Language Server Integration.\nAsync/Await\nI would really love to see the async/await story come to a close in 2019.  The rust team has laid the groundwork with the 2018 edition, and together with the new pinning API I feel like it's just around the corner.  This has the opportunity to really change the landscape and make rust a much more productive language.\nI've had a crack at writing both a multipart client &amp; ZeroMQ library, but I can see that when the async stuff reaches stable, it's going to make life a lot easier.   Kudos to the team for moving this forward (I also happen to think the logo for futures-rs is pretty rad!)\nDocumentation Churn\nWith these changes to async, there is going to be some challenges around documentation.  I feel in tokio-land there is a high degree of tribal knowledge that, if you don't keep up with things, you are left behind.\nThere is the new futures 0.3 crate, which is not currently in use by tokio crate, you have to use futures 0.1.  No-one knows what happened to 0.2, it's a mystery left for future rust historians, and 0.3 is still very much in alpha. Earlier on in the year if you went straight to the docs.rs page for futures, this would direct you to the 0.3 version, which isn't helpful if you are using this in conjunction with tokio (this appears to be resolved now, by some clever use of yanking).\nAnother example is the move away from tokio-core into the standard tokio crate.  This is something that is a great evolution for tokio, but has left a number of libraries outdated.  A lot of the great blogs by pioneering devs have also become outdated when dealing with this, which increases the frustration for any newcomers.  I am hoping that now things are more settled that this won't be much of an issue.\nAll of these changes adds to a high level of fatigue for developers.  If you're not lucky enough to be working in this space day-to-day, coming back after 6 months would be daunting.  There is a push to help modernise the documentation, but this hasn't seen much activity in a couple of months.  I'm hoping to find some time in the new year to help out with this, as I think there is a lot of work to be done.\nConclusion\nI think rust has come a long way and still has a long way to go.  I focused a lot of energy on writing apps in rust this year, and will undoubtably accelerate the usage as time goes on.\nI hope that the rust team has time to put on the breaks, and apply a bit of polish before doing anything major.  I also hope I have more time to contribute some bits and pieces here and there to make the community better.\n","id":"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/rust-2019/","title":"My Wishes for Rust 2019"},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/rust-2020/":{"body":"2019 was another huge year for rust, but instead of implementing the shiny new thing, it's been a focus on refining existing ideas.\nHaving being using rust professionally for over 3 years, I feel I will very soon be regailing new rust developers of the times before NLL &amp; async, where we had to play lexicon-fu to get things like caches to work in a reasonable fashion, or using super dooper combinator chains and wrestling with futures types (Either::A/B anyone?).\nSo I'd like to make clear my acknowledgement that I am happy with the direction that the rust language is heading in, and these requests are really nice to haves.\nThe Future of Futures\nThe async/await is on track to be stabilised next month, which means it's not a goal for 2020, but we have to look back to the futures-rs! There is a whole ecosystem that now needs to play catchup and I hope that it does within the year 2020.\nI also really hope they start using the logo a bit more!\n\nTokio version 1.0\nI would like to see tokio version 1.0 in 2020.  I would also like the core of tokio to be trimmed down immensely for inclusion as a dependency.  Just a small wish I know!\nI understand the reluctance to brand it as 1.0 but there is already a lot of churn from the move from tokio-core last year.  This would also signal to users that it is mostly stabilised, since async/await is dropping soon. I haven't been following development closely to know if there are any further blockers beyond this though.\nAlternatives to tokio\nI'd also like to see more than one library for async reach wide use.  I'd like to be able to mix and match executors with library code, and choose an implementation.  The promise of async/await should allow for this in theory, but we'll have to see what it's like in practice.\nThis will both add a bit of healthy competition to the ecosystem but will also prevent future design decisions from library bias.\nI know that async-std is a great contender here and I hope that one day I could use this as a (mostly) drop in replacement for running my futures.\nThis might already be possible, but I'd have no idea how to integrate this to my existing libraries (i.e, tmq and mpart-async) in an agnostic fashion.\nNon-Async stuff\nSome more care needs to be put into the non-async world.  There was a great thread about an alternative to reqwest which doesn't require the entire async stack to run.\nI would also like to see the blending of async and sync code made easier. Sometimes you want to use a db pool such as diesel, and currently that is a very messy thing to do.\nIt would be great if that bridge was seamless and doesn't shoot you in the foot (i.e, make it a compile time guarantee to ensure no blocking code in async).\nChat and Community Channels\nI really enjoyed the IRC chat room, but as Mozilla is decommissioning it, it feels like there is now a massive empty hole where a good resource use to be.\nThis isn't really something that the rust team themselves can do anything about, but I also don't think fragmenting team discussions across a variety of chat platforms sets a good precedent for the greater rust community.\nI don't have any direct qualms about using discord (which is currently recommended on the community page) but it would be preferable if whatever was chosen was both accessible and open.  I'd love it to be matrix, but riot is a bit of a clunky client, and there isn't really a better alternative client.  Discord has much more polish.\n(As an aside the fediverse stuff is pretty cool! mastodon and pixelfed are great apps and I wish we saw more rusty stuff in this space)\nReflecting on Last Year's Wishes\nMy last blog I had 3 main areas of improvement that I would like to have seen a focus on.\nCompiler Times, IDE Support and RLS\nThis is still in flux but appears to be a step in the right direction.  move over rls and welcome rust-analyzer.\nIt seems the IDE story is a lot better, but still a long way off.  Who knew it could be so hard!  IntelliJ has made strides this year in making their IDE much better.  Still though, every few months I load up some of my bigger rust projects, only to have some weirdness show up.\nI feel like this is very much an aspirational goal though, IDEs for all languages continue and improve to get better with time.  It's not ever going to be the ideal of an IDE, but it's trending towards it.\nAsync/Await\nThe Async/Await story definitely improved with the imminent release (as of this blog) of async syntax landing on stable. \nWhile there was a substantial amount of dogfooding around the syntax, I feel that the language team has settled on an appropriate solution.  It looks a bit weird at first, but the promise of having match or others use the same syntax style is intruiging.\nDocumentation Churn\nThis is still an area of concern, but has been addressed mostly in some of the frameworks I've seen.  I feel like this won't be fixed until all the ecosystem has stabilised around new language features and we land a few more 1.0 crates.\nIt's going to be a hassle redoing examples with async keywords!\nConclusion\nI am happy with the way things have progressed throughout 2019 and I feel that 2020 is going to be a massively exciting time for rust.\nI don't feel there is a need for another epoch just yet, considering we're still working through the current one.\nLet's work towards polishing the async ecosystem for this year, and hopefully we'll have a very compelling story for everyone else to get involved.\n","id":"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/rust-2020/","title":"My Wishes for Rust 2020"},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/tmq-0-1-0/":{"body":"TMQ is a rust library to use ZeroMQ within the Tokio ecosystem.  ZeroMQ is a distributed messaging queue written in C supporting a number of different messaging patterns.  While there are other options out there (including gRPC, etc..), I settled on ZeroMQ due to its cross-language support, great documentation and battle-tested nature.\nVersion 0.1.0 is an alpha release which implements request, response, publish and subscribe style sockets.\nUsage Example\nThis example uses tmq to subscribe to messages, and then prints them out via pretty-env-logger:\nextern crate failure;\nextern crate futures;\n#[macro_use]\nextern crate log;\nextern crate pretty_env_logger;\nextern crate tmq;\nextern crate tokio;\n\nuse futures::{Future, Stream};\nuse tmq::*;\nuse std::env;\n\nfn main() {\n    if let Err(_) = env::var(\"RUST_LOG\") {\n        env::set_var(\"RUST_LOG\", \"subscribe=DEBUG\");\n    }\n\n    pretty_env_logger::init();\n\n    let request = subscribe(&amp;Context::new())\n        .connect(\"tcp://127.0.0.1:7899\")\n        .expect(\"Couldn't connect\")\n        .subscribe(\"\")\n        .for_each(|val| {\n            info!(\"Subscribe: {}\", val.as_str().unwrap_or(\"\"));\n            Ok(())\n        })\n        .map_err(|e| {\n            error!(\"Error Subscribing: {}\", e);\n        });\n\n    tokio::run(request);\n}\n\nOther examples of usage can be found in the project itself: https://github.com/cetra3/tmq/tree/master/examples\nExisting Rust Crates\nTo find out where tmq sits within the rust ecosystem, it makes sense to discuss this in terms of other ZeroMQ crates.\nzmq - Rust ZeroMQ Bindings\nThis library has bindings to the C API and provides a great way to use ZeroMQ within rust.  You still need a copy of ZeroMQ on your system and need it compiled in, but that difficulty is pretty much on par with using OpenSSL.  I have managed to use this library in OSX, CentOS and Ubuntu with not many issues.\nThe only downside of this library is the lack of bindings to tokio, and is one of the primary motivators for creating tmq.\nzmq.rs - A Native Implementation of ZeroMQ in Rust\nThis library was a Rewrite in Rust attempt at a full ZeroMQ reimplementation, which hasn't seen any changes since 2015 and can probably be considered abandoned.  Regardless: this API is still the old blocking style, which would still predicate a need for tmq\nzmq-tokio - Run ØMQ sockets using tokio reactors, futures, etc.\nNot even published on crates.io but a great initial attempt at bridging the async gap.  This crate used the historic tokio-core library which is a bit of a pain to adapt to the new tokio crate.  Unfortunately it looks like it's since been abandoned.\ntokio-zmq - ZeroMQ Concepts with futures on Tokio's runtime\nThis library is probably the most polished version for tokio and one that would be compared mostly to tmq.\nI would have chosen this library, but the one major roadblock is the GPL license.  The GPL within a rust project is viral.  You can't use this library without making the rest of your project GPL or GPL Compatible. If this doesn't concern you, then I would consider using this library.\nComparison between tmq\nIn comparison to tokio-zmq, tmq has less boilerplate to acheive the same thing, but does use a couple of custom traits to speed things along.  This makes tmq a bit more opinionated, but less verbose.\nBoth styles have their merits, tokio-zmq does give you more control over things wheras tmq is, in my opinion, easier to write and reason about, but more restrictive in how you use it.\nTo do a direct comparison of both libraries we're using the response example.  This example is a simple echo response, which when it receives a message, it echos it back verbatim to the requester.\ntokio-zmq\nHere is the excerpt from tokio-zmq:\nlet ctx = Arc::new(zmq::Context::new());\nlet req_fut = Req::builder(ctx).connect(\"tcp://localhost:5560\").build();\n\nlet runner = req_fut.and_then(|req| {\n    req.send(build_multipart(0)).and_then(|req| {\n        let (sink, stream) = req.sink_stream(25).split();\n\n        stream\n            .zip(iter_ok(1..10_000))\n            .map(|(multipart, i)| {\n                for msg in multipart {\n                    if let Some(msg) = msg.as_str() {\n                        println!(\"Received: {}\", msg);\n                    }\n                }\n                build_multipart(i)\n            })\n            .forward(sink)\n    })\n});\n\nOn of the things you will notice is there is a lot of standard futures and tokio types used here: sink, stream, etc..  While this does make it more verbose, you are using constructs that you are familiar with in the futures style.\ntmq\nHere's a similar example (although not using multipart messages) from tmq:\nlet responder = respond(&amp;Context::new())\n    .bind(\"tcp://127.0.0.1:7899\")?\n    .with(|msg: Message| {\n        info!(\"Request: {}\", msg.as_str().unwrap_or(\"\"));\n        Ok(msg)\n    });\n\nYou'll notice that the library has a bit less boilerplate, but is more opinionated on how you structure a response.\nInstead of a sink/stream approach, the responder is a stream but has a with method.  The with method takes anything that implements the Responder trait, of which there is a blanket implemenation for closures and functions that take a message and return a message.\nFuture Changes\nWhile currently usable, the tmq library is far from finished and requires some work to bring it out of an alpha state.  In no particular order here are the plans for the library:\nTesting\nUnit tests and integration tests need to be added in order to confirm and wire up connections.  As the library is rather lightweight now the need for integration tests hasn't really arisen, but this will become more complicated in the future as more socket types are added.\nBenchmarking\nBenchmarks need to be added to the library in order to show the performance of using this over standard zmq.  Running up some dummy benchmarks show that it is perfomant enough for my current use case, and provides less overhead than your standard REST API calls.\nWindows Support\nI cheated a little by using the Evented trait for mio, which makes it dead easy to use in tokio via PollEvented2.\nUnfortunately the async story on windows is a bit different, and I haven't had a need to deploy on windows just yet.  But it is something that has been considered.\nDocumentation\nThe library is mostly undocumented besides from the examples.  Documentation should be pretty easy to do at this stage and won't take too long.\nMore Socket Types\nImplementing more socket types, to make this feature complete with the standard zmq library.  There a plethora of different socket types for different use cases that give different guarantees.  The 4 standard ones implemented are enough for me to start using this library today, but could easily be expanded.\nMultipart messages\nMultipart support for messages.  Currently this is not supported, but should be mostly easy to implement\nFurther thoughts\nI'm currently using tmq within an actix-web application to bridge some messages and audit logs between a polyglot backend (including Java &amp; Python).  It has been quite solid so far, and I have plans to remove an existing ActiveMQ service to be replaced with tmq where appropriate.\nVersion 0.1.0 is the first real release, with previous releases having to vendor in the zmq library in order to publish.   While it is alpha, I don't plan to change what is there currently unless there is a compelling reason to do so.\nPlease give tmq a try and let me know your thoughts!\n","id":"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/tmq-0-1-0/","title":"TMQ 0.1.0 Release: ZeroMQ bindings for Tokio"}},"docInfo":{"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/breaking-api-changes/":{"body":638,"title":4},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/face-detection-with-actix-web/":{"body":2289,"title":4},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/face-detection-with-tensorflow-rust/":{"body":1038,"title":4},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/implementing-a-jobq-with-tokio/":{"body":1109,"title":5},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/implementing-a-jobq/":{"body":2220,"title":6},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/lorikeet-0-11-0/":{"body":388,"title":4},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/mpart-async-0-3-0/":{"body":874,"title":5},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/rust-2019/":{"body":486,"title":3},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/rust-2020/":{"body":535,"title":3},"https://cetra3.github.io/blog/tmq-0-1-0/":{"body":659,"title":6}},"length":11}};
